             PST ART: Art and Science Collide
            </em>
            initiative, the exhibition unfolds across six sites at the hermetic institution. In it, materials from Caltech’s archives are presented alongside work by artists such as Helen Pashgian, Lita Albuquerque, and Lia Halloran in spaces that are usually reserved for scientific research and instruction. In wielding scientific materials as and alongside aesthetic ones, the exhibition makes all of Caltech into a playground for various forms of observation.

            <p>
             The artists — Halloran, Lita Albuquerque, Jane Brucker, Shana Mabari, and Helen Pashgian — were inspired by a century of monumental discoveries from the physicists, engineers, chemists, and other scientists who have made Caltech one of the most elite scientific research institutions in the world. The show is divided into sections (The Infinite Lawn, Time Stream, and Powers of Ten) to cluster technological advancements into their own themed galleries, particularly in astronomy, physics, and chemistry — but that’s by no means every discipline covered in this show.

            <p>
             Among the standout pieces is an image that Collopy describes as “the first TV image of Mars,” taken by Mariner 4 in 1965. This iconic image, transmitted as a digital photograph by radio from Mars to Earth, exemplifies the technological and visual advancements central to Caltech’s scientific legacy.
            </p>
            <p>
             The feedback from visitors has been overwhelmingly positive. “People are especially drawn to the merging of scientific and artistic elements,” Collopy shared, adding that many visitors appreciate the cohesive layout and design of the exhibition, which spans multiple campus sites. By making the exhibition free to the public, Caltech hopes to engage both the campus community and the wider public in this unique journey through science and art.

            If you enter the Caltech campus from the west side, walking along the grassy Bechtel Mall framed by the oldest buildings at the school, the first things you see of the
            <em>
             Crossing Over
            </em>
            series are Shana Mabari’s
            <em>
             Spectrum Petals
            </em>
            . This wonderful series of seven sculptures – each a smooth plastic disc about 3 feet in diameter and 6 inches thick – are spread across the lawn, standing on edge as if they just landed from outer space.
           </p>
           <p>
            The discs — in red, blue, green, yellow, orange — look like semi-transparent lenses, perhaps designed for a large telescope. In fact, they’re slightly reflective, casting odd bands of color on the grass. (The squirrels foraging on the lawn near a disc seem spooked by the appearance of an identical squirrel looking back at them.)
