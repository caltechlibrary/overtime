The book adds a timely contribution to the model minority discourse."The contributors to this book demonstrate that the insidious model minority stereotype is alive and well. At the same time, the chapters carefully and powerfully examine ways to deconstruct and speak back to these misconceptions of Asian Americans. Hartlep and Porfilio pull together an important volume for anyone interested in how racial and ethnic stereotypes play out in the lives of people of color across various contexts." - Vichet Chhuon, University of Minnesota Twin Cities"This volume presents valuable additions to the model minority literature exploring narratives challenging stereotypes in a wide range of settings and providing helpful considerations for research and practice." - David W. Chih, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"Asian Pacific Islander adolescents and young adults are especially impacted by the model minority stereotype, and this volume details the real-life consequences for them and for all communities of color. The contributors provide a wide-ranging critique and deconstruction of the stereotype by uncovering many of its manifestations, and they also take the additional step of outlining clear strategies to undo the stereotype and prevent its deleterious effects on API youth. Killing the Model Minority Stereotype: Asian American Counterstories and Complicity is an essential read for human service professionals, educators, therapists, and all allies of communities of color." - Joseph R. Mills, LICSW, Asian Counseling and Referral Service, Seattle WA

Much of his discussion of Korean science focuses on instruments which he describes in great detail in chapters on astronomy, metereology, physics and physical technology, and geography and cartography.Faced with the considerable difficulty of writing a history based on inadequate written records, Dr. Jeon has made use of available artifacts and other materials which have received little attention either in East Asia or the West. He has also summarized historical research in Korean science to the present and compiled an extensive bibliography.

J. Michael Martinez argues that Abraham Lincoln and the Radical Republicans in Congress were the pivotal actors, albeit not the architects, that influenced this evolution. To understand how Lincoln and his contemporaries viewed race, Martinez first explains the origins of abolitionism and the tumultuous decade of the 1830s, when that generation of political leaders came of age. He then follows the trail through Reconstruction, Redemption, and the beginnings of legal segregation in the 1880s. This book addresses the central question of how and why the concept of race changed during this period." data-html="true" data-placement="bottom" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" id="s-lg-book-title-55974239">

               <span class="s-lg-book-title" data-content="No one could have predicted that the night of September 17, 1998, would be anything but routine in Houston, Texas. Even the call to police that a black man was &quot;going crazy with a gun&quot; was hardly unusual in this urban setting. Nobody could have imagined that the arrest of two men for a minor criminal offense would reverberate in American constitutional law, exposing a deep malignity in our judicial system and challenging the traditional conception of what makes a family. Indeed, when Harris County sheriff's deputies entered the second-floor apartment, there was no gun. Instead, they reported that they had walked in on John Lawrence and Tyron Garner having sex in Lawrence's bedroom.        So begins Dale Carpenter's &quot;gripping and brilliantly researched&quot; Flagrant Conduct, a work nine years in the making that transforms our understanding of what we thought we knew about Lawrence v. Texas, the landmark Supreme Court decision of 2003 that invalidated America's sodomy laws. Drawing on dozens of interviews, Carpenter has taken on the &quot;gargantuan&quot; task of extracting the truth about the case, analyzing the claims of virtually every person involved.        Carpenter first introduces us to the interracial defendants themselves, who were hardly prepared &quot;for the strike of lightning&quot; that would upend their lives, and then to the Harris County arresting officers, including a sheriff's deputy who claimed he had &quot;looked eye to eye&quot; in the faces of the men as they allegedly fornicated. Carpenter skillfully navigates Houston's complex gay world of the late 1990s, where a group of activists and court officers, some of them closeted themselves, refused to bury what initially seemed to be a minor arrest.        The author charts not only the careful legal strategy that Lambda Legal attorneys adopted to make the case compatible to a conservative Supreme Court but also the miscalculations of the Houston prosecutors who assumed that the nation's extant sodomy laws would be upheld. Masterfully reenacting the arguments that riveted spectators and Justices alike in 2003, Flagrant Conduct then reaches a point where legal history becomes literature, animating a Supreme Court decision as few writers have done.        In situating Lawrence v. Texas within the larger framework of America's four-century persecution of gay men and lesbians, Flagrant Conduct compellingly demonstrates that gay history is an integral part of our national civil rights story." data-html="true" data-placement="bottom" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" id="s-lg-book-title-71339910">

Gender and sexuality, repression and resistance, deviance and acceptance, identity and community-all are given a context in this fascinating work.    &quot;A landmark of a book and a landmark of ideas that will shatter ignorance and delusion.&quot;-Catharine Stimpson,University Professor and Dean Emerita of the Graduate School of Arts and Science at New York University    &quot;Ground-breaking.&quot;-Publishers Weekly    &quot;The juxtaposition of diverse perspectives and research crossing boundaries of race, gender, culture, and time encourages a lively dialogue.

This book dismantles that persistent positivism with a forceful critique, then fills the void with a new paradigm for Indigenous quantitative methods, using concrete examples of research projects from First World Indigenous peoples in the United States, Australia, and Canada.

               In the first book ever published on Indigenous quantitative methodologies, Maggie Walter and Chris Andersen open up a major new approach to research across the disciplines and applied fields. While qualitative methods have been rigorously critiqued and reformulated, the population statistics relied on by virtually all research on Indigenous peoples continue to be taken for granted as straightforward, transparent numbers. This book dismantles that persistent positivism with a forceful critique, then fills the void with a new paradigm for Indigenous quantitative methods, using concrete examples of research projects from First World Indigenous peoples in the United States, Australia, and Canada. Concise and accessible, it is an ideal supplementary text as well as a core component of the methodological toolkit for anyone conducting Indigenous research or using Indigenous population statistics.
