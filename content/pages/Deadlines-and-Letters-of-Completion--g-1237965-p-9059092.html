It is easier for them to remove you from the graduation list than to add you! They may also be able to make special accommodations, especially if your defense date is what is causing the delay.

           Getting your Letter of Completion
          </h4>
          <p>
           If you are in a hurry to get your Letter of Completion from the Registrar, it is your responsibility to notify both the Grad Office and Library.  The best time to do so is right after you have deposited your thesis into CaltechTHESIS.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            The Library will do its best to review your thesis deposit as quickly as possible.
            <ul>
             <li>
              It may return the record to you for corrections, sending a separate detailed email detailing what's needed.
             </li>
             <li>
              You must make the corrections within the record and upload corrected files as needed.  Resubmit the record for final review.
             </li>
             <li>
              Once the CaltechTHESIS deposit is satoi9sfactory, the Library will notify the Grad Office, and then waits to receive the thesis' final approval.
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
            We highly recommend that you keep track of your status in your REGIS account.  Be proactive - missing signatures and forms can slow things down while you're waiting for final approval from the Grad Office.
            <ul>
             <li>
              If no longer have access tp REGIS, contact either the Grad Office or the Registrar's Office, where someone can check your account for you.
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
            Once the Grad Office has given final approval for your thesis, the Library will be notified, and staff will update your CaltechTHESIS record.  That last action will trigger an automated email to the Registrar, who will add the final updates to your REGIS account.
           </li>
           <li>
            Your Letter of Completion should be generated in PDF format and available for download within 12-24 hours after the Registrar has updated your record.  Contact the Grad Office or Registrar to retrieve it for you if you no longer have access to REGIS.
