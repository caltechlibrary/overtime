               When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education. On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. I Am Malala is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons. I Am Malala will make you believe in the power of one person's voice to inspire change in the world.

               Nelson Mandela has become a legend in his own lifetime; the embodiment of the struggle for liberation in South Africa and the symbol of its triumph. In this biography, the author describes Mandela's life, work and ideas from his childhood in the royal family of the Thembu people to his membership of the African National Congress, including the many years in captivity on Robben Island and the birth of the hope that came with his release.

               We long for heroes and have too few. Nelson Mandela, who died in 2013 at the age of ninety-five, is the closest thing the world has to a secular saint. He liber¬ated a country from a system of violent prejudice and helped unite oppressor and oppressed in a way that had never been done before. Now Richard Stengel, the editor of Time maga¬zine, has distilled countless hours of intimate conver¬sation with Mandela into fifteen essential life lessons. For nearly three years, including the critical period when Mandela moved South Africa toward the first democratic elections in its history, Stengel collaborated with Mandela on his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, and traveled with him everywhere. Eating with him, watching him campaign, hearing him think out loud, Stengel came to know all the different sides of this complex man and became a cherished friend and colleague. In Mandela’s Way, Stengel recounts the moments in which “the grandfather of South Africa” was tested and shares the wisdom he learned: why courage is more than the absence of fear, why we should keep our rivals close, why the answer is not always either/or but often “both,” how important it is for each of us to find something away from the world that gives us pleasure and satisfaction - our own garden. Woven into these life lessons are remarkable stories - of Mandela’s child¬hood as the protégé of a tribal king, of his early days as a freedom fighter, of the twenty-seven-year imprison¬ment that could not break him, and of his fulfilling remarriage at the age of eighty. This uplifting book captures the spirit of this extraordinary man - warrior, martyr, husband, statesman, and moral leader - and spurs us to look within ourselves, reconsider the things we take for granted, and contemplate the legacy we’ll leave behind.

               Different areas of science characteristically enjoy "peak" periods, during which curiosity and concern about unsolved problems, availability of research support, and emerging new results and insights combine to yield eras of exceptional productivity. Shark research is enjoying such a peak phase at the present time [1978]. This makes it an especially exciting, as well as a useful, time to take stock of what is known (and what is not known) in this area of sensory physiology and animal behavior.
