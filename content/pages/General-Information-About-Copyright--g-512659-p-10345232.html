            How is a copyright different from a patent or a trademark?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Copyright protects original works of authorship, while a patent protects inventions or discoveries. Ideas and discoveries are not protected by the copyright law, although the way in which they are expressed may be. A trademark protects words, phrases, symbols, or designs identifying the source of the goods or services of one party and distinguishing them from those of others.

           <strong>
            What does copyright protect?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Copyright, a form of intellectual property law, protects original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed. See Circular 1,
           <i>
            Copyright Basics
           </i>

          <p>
           <strong>
            When is my work protected?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Do I have to register with your office to be protected?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           No. In general, registration is voluntary. Copyright exists from the moment the work is created. You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work. See Circular 1,
           <i>

            How long does a copyright last?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           The term of copyright for a particular work depends on several factors, including whether it has been published, and, if so, the date of first publication. As a general rule, for works created after January 1, 1978, copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus an additional 70 years. For an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year of its first publication or a term of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first. For works first published prior to 1978, the term will vary depending on several factors. To determine the length of copyright protection for a particular work, consult

            How do I get permission to use somebody else's work?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           You can ask for it. If you know who the copyright owner is, you may contact the owner directly. If you are not certain about the ownership or have other related questions, you may wish to request that the Copyright Office conduct a search of its records or you may search yourself. See the next question for more details.

            What is Fair Use?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Fair use is a legal doctrine that promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances, and uses
           <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107">
            Section 107 of the Copyright Act
           </a>
           as its framework.
          </p>
          <p>
           Section 107 calls for consideration of the following four factors in evaluating a question of fair use:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes
           </li>
           <li>
            Nature of the copyrighted work
           </li>
           <li>
            Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
           </li>
           <li>
            Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           In addition to the above, other factors may also be considered by a court in weighing a fair use question, depending upon the circumstances. Courts evaluate fair use claims on a case-bycase basis, and the outcome of any given case depends on a fact-specific inquiry. This means that there is no formula to ensure that a predetermined percentage or amount of a work—or specific number of words, lines, pages, copies—may be used without permission.

           Under the
           <i>
            fair use
           </i>
           doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is permissible to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and scholarly reports. There are no legal rules permitting the use of a specific number of words, a certain number of musical notes, or percentage of a work. Whether a particular use qualifies as fair use depends on all the circumstances. See,
