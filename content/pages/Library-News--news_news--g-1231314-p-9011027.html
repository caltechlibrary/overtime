               The Library is delighted to announce that Research Data Specialist Tom Morrell and the CaltechDATA team have been awarded a generous grant as part of the National Science Foundation Campus Cyberinfrastructure program. Through a collaboration between the Library and Caltech’s Information Management Systems and Services (IMSS), the award will allow the standard free storage allocation in CaltechDATA to be expanded from 500 GB per research group to 1 TB per researcher.
              </p>
              <p>
               University Librarian Kara Whatley explains the award's significance: "This grant is extremely important for the sharing of open scientific data at Caltech. Our researchers are in the business of cutting-edge science, and now their work will be accessible to others who want to build upon it. The Caltech Library and IMSS are thrilled to partner on this project to support Caltech researchers.”
              </p>
              <p>
               We took this opportunity to ask Tom Morrell some questions about the grant.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Congratulations on receiving this generous grant from the National Science Foundation! What kind of projects were considered for this grant solicitation?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The NSF program funds a wide variety of campus cyberinfrastructure, from networking to supercomputers. We specifically applied for the data storage part of the program, which provides funding for campuses to expand their research data offerings.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What were some of the strengths of the CaltechDATA proposal?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Our proposal was a really close collaboration between the library and Caltech’s Information Management Systems and Services (IMSS), and we were able to harness the library’s expertise for managing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data with IMSS’s expertise in running campus cyberinfrastructure to create a compelling proposal. In addition, fifteen research groups at Caltech made specific storage requests and committed to sharing research data publicly. We also utilized the open source architecture of the Open Storage Network to ensure that we’d have a performant and sustainable storage platform. Caltech Library actually piloted connecting the Open Storage Network to our CaltechDATA repository through an NSF ACCESS storage allocation, so by the time we submitted the proposal, we were confident that all the technical components would work.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Could you tell us a little about the collaboration between the Library and Information Management Systems and Services (IMSS)?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The expanded data services this grant will support build on the strengths of both the library and IMSS. One aspect of this proposal was a campus cyberinfrastructure plan, and IMSS was critical in explaining how this storage will complement the existing services and infrastructure. IMSS will also host the physical storage hardware. The library is responsible for running the CaltechDATA repository, as well as offering training and support to researchers across campus.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What is the role of Open Storage Network?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Open Storage Network provides the software and management of the storage hardware that we’ll be purchasing. One of the challenges for running a campus storage service is that you need experts on staff to configure and manage the storage software. Open Storage Network allows those experts to work centrally and build one software configuration that is deployed at universities across the country. We then access the storage through a standard S3 interface, so Open Storage Network looks like any other cloud storage service to both researchers and software applications.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What will CaltechDATA be able to achieve with this grant?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               We’ll be able to expand the standard free storage allocation in CaltechDATA from 500 GB per research group to 1 TB per researcher. We’ll also be able to provide the fifteen research groups that participated in the proposal all of the storage they requested. In addition, other research groups at Caltech will have the ability to purchase additional storage at low cost.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Who will be some of the primary beneficiaries of this funding?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               This funding will have many beneficiaries. We’ll be able to provide global access to raw data from cutting-edge microscopes, telescopes, and supercomputers that are currently limited to Caltech researchers. A portion of the storage resource will made also be made available through the NSF ACCESS program, allowing researchers across the country to apply for an allocation and efficiently store files. We’ll also be able to support a diverse group of student workers who will engage in the management of CaltechDATA and OSN storage.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What are you most looking forward to?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I’m really looking forward to helping more researchers on campus create FAIR data. To date, CaltechDATA has had to limit the size of files we can accept in order to make sure our service is sustainable. With the funding from this grant, we won’t really have those limitations and can offer solutions to everyone on campus who has data they want to share.

              <br/>
              <p>
               The InvenioRDM GitHub Archiver (IGA) is a new software tool created by the Caltech Library.
               <a data-tracked="1" dir="auto" href="https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
                InvenioRDM
               </a>
               is the basis for many institutional repositories, such as
               <a dir="auto" href="https://data.caltech.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
                CaltechDATA
               </a>
               , that enable users to preserve software and data sets in a long-term archive. Though such repositories are critical resources, creating detailed records and uploading assets can be a tedious and error-prone process if done manually. This is where our new tool comes in. IGA creates metadata records and sends releases automatically from GitHub to an InvenioRDM-based repository server. The metadata contained in the record of a deposit is critical to making the record widely discoverable by other people.

               InvenioRDM is a research data management (RDM) repository platform based on the

               . Of particular interest to software developers is that a repository like CaltechDATA offers the means to preserve software projects in a long-term archive managed by their institution.

               <em>
                Crossing Over
               </em>
               considers how scientists use visual culture, examining the roles images and artists have played in scientific institutions. Far from depicting information impartially, scientific images make arguments, persuading viewers to accept particular theories and interpretations. Caltech, founded in the late 19th century, serves as a case study for how scientific images have been used over the 20th and 21st centuries and how they’ve evolved. Spanning 100 years, two global pandemics, and four venues across campus,
               <em>
                Crossing Over
               </em>
               mines the Caltech archives for objects, images, and stories illustrating the complex interchange between science and the visual arts at this influential institution. Caltech physicist Richard Feynman, for example, created a widely used system for depicting the behavior of subatomic particles, known as Feynman diagrams. Three contemporary Los Angeles artists—Lita Albuquerque, Ken Gonzales-Day, and Hillary Mushkin—contribute original, site-specific installations.
