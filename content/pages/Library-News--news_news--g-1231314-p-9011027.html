               Introducing the InvenioRDM GitHub Archiver (IGA)
              </a>
              <span class="pull-right">

              <br/>
              <p>
               The InvenioRDM GitHub Archiver (IGA) is a new software tool created by the Caltech Library.
               <a data-tracked="1" dir="auto" href="https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
                InvenioRDM
               </a>
               is the basis for many institutional repositories, such as
               <a dir="auto" href="https://data.caltech.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
                CaltechDATA
               </a>
               , that enable users to preserve software and data sets in a long-term archive. Though such repositories are critical resources, creating detailed records and uploading assets can be a tedious and error-prone process if done manually. This is where our new tool comes in. IGA creates metadata records and sends releases automatically from GitHub to an InvenioRDM-based repository server. The metadata contained in the record of a deposit is critical to making the record widely discoverable by other people.
              </p>
              <p>
               InvenioRDM is a research data management (RDM) repository platform based on the
               <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org/products/framework/">
                Invenio Framework
               </a>
               and

                Zenodo
               </a>
               . Of particular interest to software developers is that a repository like CaltechDATA offers the means to preserve software projects in a long-term archive managed by their institution.

               considers how scientists use visual culture, examining the roles images and artists have played in scientific institutions. Far from depicting information impartially, scientific images make arguments, persuading viewers to accept particular theories and interpretations. Caltech, founded in the late 19th century, serves as a case study for how scientific images have been used over the 20th and 21st centuries and how they’ve evolved. Spanning 100 years, two global pandemics, and four venues across campus,
               <em>
                Crossing Over
               </em>
               mines the Caltech archives for objects, images, and stories illustrating the complex interchange between science and the visual arts at this influential institution. Caltech physicist Richard Feynman, for example, created a widely used system for depicting the behavior of subatomic particles, known as Feynman diagrams. Three contemporary Los Angeles artists—Lita Albuquerque, Ken Gonzales-Day, and Hillary Mushkin—contribute original, site-specific installations.

                2023 Three Minute Thesis (3MT) event
               </a>
               —an academic research communication competition developed by The University of Queensland in Australia—took place on Tuesday, April 25 in Cahill's Hameetman Auditorium. The Three Minute Thesis competition challenges Caltech graduate students to explain their research in an engaging and clear three-minute talk intended for a non-specialist audience. The event was also livestreamed on YouTube to audience members who could not attend in person.
              </p>
              <p>
               After being chosen during a round of video submissions, the thirteen finalists took the stage with one slide each and three minutes to explain their research. First place winner
               <strong>
                Niyati Desai
               </strong>
               assumed the guise of an interplanetary real estate agent ("Meet the Goldilox") to explain her work with Dimitri Mawet in the Exoplanet Technology Lab. She'll receive the grand prize of $3000. Last year's third place prize and People's Choice Award winner
               <strong>
                Skyler Ware
               </strong>

                Sophie Miller
               </strong>

              </p>
              <p>
               Given Caltech’s prominence in science and engineering communities, the Library feels it's important to give Caltech graduate students the opportunity to practice communicating their science in ways that will resonate and inspire. The graduate students who competed in the 2023 3MT competition represented five Caltech divisions: Biology &amp; Biological Engineering, Chemistry &amp; Chemical Engineering, Engineering &amp; Applied Science, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, and Physics, Mathematics, &amp; Astronomy. This year's 3MT competition was supported by diamond sponsors EBSCO Information Services, Elsevier, and Thieme Science of Synthesis, gold sponsors Institute of Physics and Wiley, and silver sponsors SPIE and Taylor &amp; Francis.

               Richard Thai comes to us from CSUN where he was the ScholarWorks (Repository) Specialist, and he previously held archivist positions at the LA84 Foundation and the National History Museum of Los Angeles County. Richard holds a BA from UC Irvine and a MLIS from UCLA, where he sits on the Information Studies Alumni Association Board. The search committee was struck by Richard’s collaborative work style and his outreach efforts. We asked Richard some questions about his role in this new position.

                Congratulations on your new position as Digital Archivist, Richard! Could you give us an introduction to what a digital archivist does?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you! I am excited to be here at Caltech.
              </p>
              <p>
               The role of a digital archivist can vary from institution to institution. At Caltech, I will be working primarily with “born-digital” materials. As you can guess, that’s materials that were created on a computer and not digitalized from a physical counterpart. So instead of preserving the letters and newspapers, I would be preserving emails and websites. More importantly, I would be developing the policies and workflows for preserving digital content and making them accessible. At other institutions, the digital archivist may also oversee digitalization as well. I am sure there are some “duties as assigned” waiting for me, too.
              </p>

               <strong>
                What inspired you to pursue a career in digital archiving?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The short answer: I like organizing stuff, I have a fondness for history, and I enjoy helping people.
              </p>
              <p>
               The long answer: I thought I wanted to pursue a career in museums but the only department that had an opening was the history department. They had a western history collection that needed processing and the archivist needed help. Like many archivists, getting a taste of working in an archive was what sent me on my archives journey.
              </p>
              <p>
               I did not intentionally set out to be a digital archivist but with things becoming increasingly digital, it is where the exciting new developments in the field are happening.

                What does a day in the life of a digital archivist look like?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               We are currently in process of developing our “born-digital” collection at Caltech and I am in the “training/discovery” phase of the job. This means I am attending training sessions, meeting with Library staff, researching standards/workflows, and testing out different software. Ask me again in a few months and I will have a better answer.

                What are some of the biggest challenges facing digital archivists in 2023?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Digital archiving is a relatively young field, so we do not have a deep history of professional practice to fall back upon. Many of my digital archivist colleagues have told me that they are learning on the job. At the same time, we are not held back by decades old professional dogma and there are a lot of opportunities to be a pioneer in the field. It is daunting but also a very exciting time to be in archives.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What do you anticipate for the future of the Caltech digital archives?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               It will be great. There are a lot of born-digital materials waiting to be collected and processed.

               We are pleased to announce that George Porter will move into the newly formed role of Repository Coordinator at Caltech Library. As the Engineering &amp; Applied Science Librarian, George has worked on our repositories since they were created. However, the Repository Coordinator role formalizes and funds the full-time work required to support and maintain  CaltechAUTHORS as a campus service. We took this opportunity to ask George some questions about his new role and Caltech repositories in general.

                Thank you.  I’m delighted to take on this new role. Repositories are collections of material. In the library world, the four primary types are: subject-based or institutional; textual or data.

                CaltechAUTHORS has been a victim of its own success. Over the course of more than 20 years, the Library has operated the repository with a small team of developers, programmers, and library staff contributing effort as priorities allowed. CaltechAUTHORS has grown to more than 100,000 records and been the source of more than 25 million global file downloads. As the largest trove of scholarly output from any single university, the time had come to provide formal, dedicated oversight for the operation. Fortunately, when the job was posted, I happened to have more than 20 years of relevant experience to offer.

                The next three to six months will see CaltechAUTHORS migrate from the EPrints platform, in continuous use since 2001, to InvenioRDM, the CERN-backed platform which underlies CaltechDATA. With such a large database, there are a great number of issues to consider and fields to map as we prepare to migrate.  As with many services which have developed organically, the metadata standards and collection policies have evolved over time. With a full-time position, it will be possible to focus on establishing a baseline for the metadata, while looking for opportunities to automate ingest and update processes.

               <p>
                The initial impetus for CaltechAUTHORS was to provide free, legally compliant access to as much Caltech scholarship as possible. In 2009, the Faculty Board refocused the Library’s effort to include documenting all of the Institute’s scholarly output, even if legal restrictions prevented the Library from distributing publisher-formatted articles. Fully addressing the Institute’s research output, current and stretching back to Caltech’s beginnings, will require multiple strategies to identify all of the material.

                 Shortly after Jack’s 98th birthday that June, his landmark organic chemistry textbook surpassed 500,000 file downloads from CaltechAUTHORS. The book has continued to be widely read from the Internet and has now been downloaded more than 1.25 million times. His co-author, the late Marjorie Caserio, gave a presentation on the organic chemistry textbook as an Internet phenomenon a few years later at an American Chemical Society meeting in San Francisco.

                 This being Caltech, the future is bright and the horizons are virtually limitless. Caltech’s mission—"to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education"—dovetails perfectly with an effort to collect that expansive research and to share it as widely as possible.
