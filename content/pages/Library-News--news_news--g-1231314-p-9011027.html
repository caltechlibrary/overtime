               The mission of Caltech Archives and Special Collections is to facilitate understanding of Caltech's role in the history of science and technology and of the research and lives of its community. Earlier this fall, the Archives conducted a search for an Archival Processing Intern to assist with surveying, arranging, and describing physical and digital records held at the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories (GALCIT), Division of Engineering and Applied Science.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) was a research institute created in 1926, at first specializing in aeronautics research. In 1930, Hungarian scientist Theodore von Karman accepted the directorship of the lab and emigrated to the United States. Under his leadership, work on rockets began there in 1936. In 1961 the name changed to Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories at the California Institute of Technology. In 2006 GALCIT was once again renamed, taking on the new and current name of Graduate Aerospace Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology (while continuing to maintain the acronym GALCIT) in order to reflect its vigorous re-engagement with space engineering and with JPL.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the conclusion of the search, DiAndra Reyes was chosen to be our new GALCIT Archival Processing Intern. She is a second year Master of Library and Information Science student at San José State University. DiAndra agreed to answer some questions so we could get to know her better.

               <strong>
                Hi DiAndra! We're happy to welcome you as the Library's new Archival Processing Intern. This position was funded by the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories (GALCIT) and you were chosen from many qualified candidates. What drew you to apply to this position?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Hello! I am truly honored to have been selected as the new GALCIT Processing Intern. Firstly, I want to thank GALCIT, Caltech Library, and Archives for giving me such an amazing professional development opportunity. There were many factors that drew me to this position. One of my motivating factors for applying was that I felt really aligned with the Caltech Archives’ focus on facilitating an understanding of Caltech’s pivotal role in the history of science and technology. I really got a sense from the job posting, as well as talking to Mariella Soprano and Kara Whatley in the interview, that the Archives and Institute really care about the preservation and discovery of its history and people, while at the same time they have a forward-looking approach to doing archival work.
              </p>
              <p>
               Although I do not have a background in Aerospace Engineering, the chance to immerse myself in a subject area with which I am less familiar adds an enriching dimension to the experience and gives me a unique opportunity to become a more versatile and collaborative archivist who can adapt to any field. Furthermore, I’ve been in the San José State University Master of Library and Information Science online program for two and a half years, and the opportunity to work on-site, get hands-on experience with the physical materials, and build interpersonal relationships with the staff and faculty, really enticed me.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What kind of courses are you currently taking in the MLIS program at San José State?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I’m currently taking an Archives Reference class, where I’m learning about reference processes, guidelines, legalities, etc. in archival institutions. Additionally, I am also doing a fall semester internship at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles, which I will be receiving school credit for.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Now that you've started working in the Archives, what does a typical day in the life of a GALCIT Archival Processing Intern look like?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               A typical day for me involves arriving at my office in the Guggenheim building at 9 a.m. Mariella Soprano, my supervisor, meets me there around the same time. I first check my calendar and emails to confirm what meetings I have for the day. Then I start working with Mariella in going through materials. We work together to decide what to keep and what to throw away, as well as conducting some basic preservation procedures like removing rusty staples and clips and flattening out papers. Then we figure out how to categorize and organize the materials into series and subseries. I input the data for the materials into a spreadsheet with titles, dates, creators, scope and content notes, etc. This spreadsheet will later be imported into ArchivesSpace. Next, I put the materials in archival folders and in their respective sections on shelves in my office. Sometimes, I also spend part of my day researching GALCIT and its history. The GALCIT website and the Caltech Archives’ oral histories website have served as valuable resources in understanding the context of the materials we are discovering.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What can you tell us about the Archives you're working on?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The GALCIT archives is a treasure trove of materials dating from the 1930s and 1940s through the present, consisting of records from the department’s initiatives and projects. It’s really a Pandora’s box, and we have still yet to know what we will find. So far, we know there are papers, large plans and drawings, and audio/visual materials. The commitment of the GALCIT department in taking the initiative to preserve all this history is truly commendable. The collection will be stored in GALCIT, in the basement of the Firestone building, while under the guardianship of the Archives department.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What do you enjoy so far about working at Caltech?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Working at Caltech has been an enriching experience so far, particularly due to the opportunity to interact with diverse individuals at GALCIT, the Archives, and the Library. Learning from passionate professionals who are doing amazing work has been truly inspiring. I hope to continue learning as much as I can about how each department functions and their impacts on the Caltech community as a whole.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Is there anything you'd like us to know before we go?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I would like to express my gratitude for the warm welcome from everyone and the opportunity to be a part of the Caltech community. I look forward to sharing our discoveries of the GALCIT collection in the near future!

               Over the summer, thanks to the American Institute of Physics (AIP) Grant for Archives, the Archives hired SJSU MLIS student, Gabriela Lazo, to begin processing the Robert F. Christy Papers. They continued with us through the fall term. In addition to the Christy papers, they were able to experience Archives and Library operations by attending staff meetings, scanning documents, and learning about archival reference. Before moving on to finish their degree, we asked Gabriela some questions about their time at Caltech. We thank Gabriela for helping the Caltech Archives and wish them well on their journey.
              </p>

               Gabriela Lazo (they/them) worked as Archives Processing Intern for the 2023 summer term and into the fall, and they live in East Los Angeles, where they were raised. Gabriela has a BA in Sociology and Chicanx Studies with specializations in Social Movements/Political Sociology and Equity/Diversity from Cal State Northridge, and they will receive their Master of Library and Information Science from San Jose State by December 2023. Gabriela spends much of their free time visiting local museums and libraries, along with getting involved in their community through mutual aid work and a radical book club!

               <strong>
                1) Hi Gabriela! How have you enjoyed your position as our first Archival Processing Intern?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I've enjoyed my time at Caltech immensely! I've learned not just about the archives field, but also of the history of Caltech and the discoveries made here. My supervisor, Penny, creates an amazing environment for me to learn about what goes into being an archivist. Not only that, but I also enjoyed the events that take place on campus, such as resource fairs and new building ceremonies. It feels as if I've only explored the tip of the iceberg of what Caltech has to offer.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                2) Robert F. Christy, who lived from 1916 to 2012, made instrumental contributions to the development of nuclear weapons in the Manhattan Project. After World War II, he went on to study the biological and health effects of radiation and conducted research in astrophysics on cosmic rays and Cepheid variable stars. Christy also served as provost and acting president of Caltech. The Christy Papers consist of correspondence, lab notebooks, photographs and slides, and other documents related to his work on dosimetry, astrophysics, and Caltech administration. Could you tell us a little about your work processing the Christy Papers?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The Christy Papers aided me in understanding the processing of archives. I began by sorting through his correspondence, which includes letters to and from world-renowned scientists. I sorted the correspondence by chronological order and created series and sub-series under the guidance of Penny. I’ve learned a great deal about Christy’s work as Caltech Provost and his involvement in the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. Christy began his work studying theoretical physics and later went on to study astrophysics. Later in life, he studied dosimetry and the effects of atomic bombings on populations impacted by bombings. I added this information to ArchivesSpace (the archives management database), making it discoverable for researchers.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                3) What does a day in the life of an Archival Processing Intern look like?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               A day in the life of an Archival Processing Intern looks like getting started by checking any emails or any online updates each morning. Then I'd begin processing the Christy papers where I last left off. Much of the materials consist of correspondence between Robert Christy and other Caltech admin dating back to the 1950s. I sort based on the contents of the materials. Additionally, I’ve also delved into work dealing with Amos G. Throop collection and the founding of Caltech. I also had the opportunity to shadow other librarians to understand the important work they do for students and researchers. Besides my archival work, I sometimes have time set out to explore the campus or join in on any events occurring at the time. I got to see something new every day at Caltech!
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                4) You're enrolled in the Master of Library and Information Science program at San Jose State University. How has it been studying in a fully online program? How has the coursework helped in processing the Christy papers?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               San Jose State's MLIS online program has provided me with a better understanding of the responsibilities of an archivist. I’ve taken courses on information communities, digital tools, cataloging, coding, and applied research. I’ve taken skills from both school and this position and utilized them in my assignments in both settings. An online schooling experience has also provided me with flexibility in my schedule for opportunities such as my position at Caltech. I feel that I've achieved a great work-school-life balance due to the program's convenience. I still have time to visit museums and libraries, along with getting involved in my community in my free time.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                5) What do you think is the most important function of any archival project?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I believe that the most important function of any archival project is to provide the people with access to history. The archivist's role is to make materials and other resources easily accessible to patrons. This aligns with my principles of making education accessible for all. There is an information gap that primarily impacts marginalized communities, so archival projects must take into account accessibility and reach. Access to quality information is a human right.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                6) What do you hope to do when you complete your degree?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I hope to work in the GLAM field (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) when I complete my degree by the end of this year. I have a passion for art and history, which I would like to pursue in my profession as an archivist. My time at Caltech, along with work in other libraries and museums, has taught me that I seek to devote my time to being an information professional.

               The Library is delighted to announce that Research Data Specialist Tom Morrell and the CaltechDATA team have been awarded a generous grant as part of the National Science Foundation Campus Cyberinfrastructure program. Through a collaboration between the Library and Caltech’s Information Management Systems and Services (IMSS), the award will allow the standard free storage allocation in CaltechDATA to be expanded from 500 GB per research group to 1 TB per researcher.
              </p>
              <p>
               University Librarian Kara Whatley explains the award's significance: "This grant is extremely important for the sharing of open scientific data at Caltech. Our researchers are in the business of cutting-edge science, and now their work will be accessible to others who want to build upon it. The Caltech Library and IMSS are thrilled to partner on this project to support Caltech researchers.”
              </p>
              <p>
               We took this opportunity to ask Tom Morrell some questions about the grant.
              </p>

               <strong>
                Congratulations on receiving this generous grant from the National Science Foundation! What kind of projects were considered for this grant solicitation?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The NSF program funds a wide variety of campus cyberinfrastructure, from networking to supercomputers. We specifically applied for the data storage part of the program, which provides funding for campuses to expand their research data offerings.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What were some of the strengths of the CaltechDATA proposal?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Our proposal was a really close collaboration between the library and Caltech’s Information Management Systems and Services (IMSS), and we were able to harness the library’s expertise for managing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data with IMSS’s expertise in running campus cyberinfrastructure to create a compelling proposal. In addition, fifteen research groups at Caltech made specific storage requests and committed to sharing research data publicly. We also utilized the open source architecture of the Open Storage Network to ensure that we’d have a performant and sustainable storage platform. Caltech Library actually piloted connecting the Open Storage Network to our CaltechDATA repository through an NSF ACCESS storage allocation, so by the time we submitted the proposal, we were confident that all the technical components would work.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Could you tell us a little about the collaboration between the Library and Information Management Systems and Services (IMSS)?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The expanded data services this grant will support build on the strengths of both the library and IMSS. One aspect of this proposal was a campus cyberinfrastructure plan, and IMSS was critical in explaining how this storage will complement the existing services and infrastructure. IMSS will also host the physical storage hardware. The library is responsible for running the CaltechDATA repository, as well as offering training and support to researchers across campus.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What is the role of Open Storage Network?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Open Storage Network provides the software and management of the storage hardware that we’ll be purchasing. One of the challenges for running a campus storage service is that you need experts on staff to configure and manage the storage software. Open Storage Network allows those experts to work centrally and build one software configuration that is deployed at universities across the country. We then access the storage through a standard S3 interface, so Open Storage Network looks like any other cloud storage service to both researchers and software applications.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What will CaltechDATA be able to achieve with this grant?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               We’ll be able to expand the standard free storage allocation in CaltechDATA from 500 GB per research group to 1 TB per researcher. We’ll also be able to provide the fifteen research groups that participated in the proposal all of the storage they requested. In addition, other research groups at Caltech will have the ability to purchase additional storage at low cost.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Who will be some of the primary beneficiaries of this funding?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               This funding will have many beneficiaries. We’ll be able to provide global access to raw data from cutting-edge microscopes, telescopes, and supercomputers that are currently limited to Caltech researchers. A portion of the storage resource will made also be made available through the NSF ACCESS program, allowing researchers across the country to apply for an allocation and efficiently store files. We’ll also be able to support a diverse group of student workers who will engage in the management of CaltechDATA and OSN storage.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What are you most looking forward to?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I’m really looking forward to helping more researchers on campus create FAIR data. To date, CaltechDATA has had to limit the size of files we can accept in order to make sure our service is sustainable. With the funding from this grant, we won’t really have those limitations and can offer solutions to everyone on campus who has data they want to share.
