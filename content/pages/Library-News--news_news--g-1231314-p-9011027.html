                 The 2024 California Library Association Conference took place at the Pasadena Convention Center on October 17-19, and several Caltech Library staff members attended.

               The California Library Association tackled the theme of mental health in the workplace at the annual conference in October. Titled

                “Balancing Act: Shelf Care &amp; Self Care,”
               </a>
               the three-day conference offered numerous lectures under a united theme of libraries as a safe environment for patrons and staff with mental health concerns.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some librarians gave presentations on activities they had organized for their communities. During “Self Care is Fresh Air,” staff from

               described organizing outdoor summer activities for both kids and adults. This included nature walks in city and state parks, and watercolors in the library garden. In another talk, Camille Hyatt shared photos and videos from animal encounters and pet adoption events for kids at the

               .
              </p>
              <p>
               Other lectures were for the direct benefit of the attendees. Some were geared toward offering career advice to librarians, including presenting at conferences or applying to jobs after finishing school. Still others, many themed around mindfulness, sought to help librarians by instructing them in practices for creating a psychologically safe workplace. Among these was a talk that acknowledged the inherent stress of working in library advocacy, and that included advice about mindfulness meant specifically for advocates. “Music, Intentionality, and Mental Health” concluded with presenter Scott Farthing asking the listeners to compile an individual “arsenal of songs” that makes each of them feel positive emotions. He recommended that listeners who live with anxiety use their personal playlist to counteract triggering situations.
              </p>
              <p>
               During the Saturday talk “Mindset Matters,” Kathleen Farris encouraged librarians to utilize kindness and self-reflection in the workplace. Particularly effective in her presentation was a slide titled “Changing Mindsets,” which encouraged workers to replace self-defeating thoughts (“I will never find a path”) with more positive, reinforcing language (“What are my options?”). Some of these presentations did not necessarily use the word “mindfulness.” However, the conference overall repeatedly demonstrated that that theme was always on the periphery of what was being discussed.
              </p>
              <p>
               By highlighting activities like music and being immersed in nature, and emphasizing themes like self-compassion, kindness, intentionality, and community, the presenters demonstrated the rewards that mindfulness can offer to library staff, students, and the public. For that reason alone, the conference was a very rewarding experience.

                  So far the processed GALCIT Collection spans from 1918 to 2005 and documents the extensive history of aeronautical engineering, fluid mechanics, and aerospace research at the GALCIT. It includes materials from significant research projects, wind tunnel developments, collaborations with military and government agencies, and the foundational work of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Some highlights include the Research Projects Series, JPL Series, and Department Series.

                  The JPL Series (1939-1986) highlights GALCIT’s early activities with JPL and includes instructional materials for military personnel by GALCIT faculty, early rocket research, and the development and usage of JPL’s supersonic wind tunnel. These materials are invaluable for understanding the collaboration between academic and military-industrial development during World War II.

                  The Department Series (1929-2005) gives insight into faculty, student, and administrative activities throughout GALCIT’s eighty-year history. Correspondence from prominent faculty like Hans W. Liepmann provides insight into their academic contributions, while classified materials and selective service documents offer a look at how GALCIT navigated national security during periods of sensitive research.

               Jo Krajeski and Benjamin Mendez Jr. worked as Archival Processing Interns this past spring and summer in the Caltech Archives and Special Collections processing the David L. Goodstein and the Judith R. Goodstein papers. This is the first time the Archives brought in two interns to collaboratively work in the archives. The Goodsteins both spent many hours in the Archives working and researching Caltech’s history, so it was fitting to have both collections successively processed. Both David’s and Judith’s collections are now both fully organized and accessible in the reading room.

               My experience as an intern for the CSULB Center for the History of Video Games, Technology, and Critical Play drew me to enroll in the SJSU MLIS program. I enjoy information in general and its importance to people. During my time in SJSU’s program, I have learned tons about the LIS field, including archives. One course that helped a lot was a course called Archives and Manuscripts. This course reviewed the importance of archives as information spaces and how to be a successful archivist.

               Genealogy and a growing love for researching historical events inspired me to pursue an MLIS at SJSU. I have been studying archival and library science for a while now (my bachelor’s degree is also LIS focused), so I am well-educated but had little practical experience. I jumped at the chance to work in the Caltech Archives. I also hoped to gain smarts through osmosis.

               I had the privilege of appraising and organizing the collections of both David and Judith R Goodstein. Depending on the day my tasks included: applying basic preservation measures to rehouse the paper materials, moving them to acid-free folders/boxes, and organizing items alphabetically, chronologically or by subject. Once the collection order was determined, we created collection guides for researchers to quickly and easily locate the information sought within their collections. It was interesting to learn what was in a collection, which determined the best way to organize it and make it accessible to archives researchers.

My day-to-day included arriving at the archive around 7:30 am till 12:30 pm, Monday only for the beginning of my internship, then after that; it sped up once summer began.

               He had a great sense of humor, which is strange to say about someone you have never met except on paper. He was also a very curious person, a great admirer (and friend) of Richard Feynman, and he formed strong lasting friendships with colleagues and others within his profession. I was very impressed by his ability and determination to learn Italian after he accepted an NSF fellowship in Rome. He would not only learn to communicate with his fellow lab team, but he would give seminars solely in Italian. I have great respect for David Goodstein.

               I guess what surprises me the most about working in archives in general is the number of ways actions can be performed; there is no one way to do any task, but the outcome is the same: to provide access to the collections. I didn’t quite know what to expect from the Caltech Archives and Special collections, but I learned there is more interesting history to be found within their stacks than I ever realized.

               Of the many important things I learned this summer, one that will stick with me is that every collection is different, and depending on the circumstances, decisions can change; as Penny would say, “It depends.” While archives have standards set in place, every day could be different, and sometimes exceptions are made. A lot depends on donor agreements and the information being processed, such as medical records or classified materials.

               Ultimately, my goal is to remain in the archival field, but I am open to anywhere in the LIS field. I have really enjoyed my time working in an academic environment, but my passion lies with genealogy so maybe a state or local archive, or something along those lines. Working with NARA would be an accomplishment.

               After graduation, I plan to work in an academic library or in an archives. If I take the librarian route, I would love to work at a community college or CSU in either an education or systems librarian role. If I go with the archivist route, I would love to work in an archive revolving around technology and video games. With only a year left in my MLIS, I am anxious but excited for what will come. The road will be tough, but I am ready for the challenge!

               This experience has been amazing. I have learned so much and felt so welcomed by the archives staff (and by extension the library crew) from my arrival to departure. I was given several learning opportunities, such as helping with reference, that helped with my coursework and gave me the hands-on experience I desired. I feel prepared to embark on other adventures and hope the archives’ staff continue to share their wisdom with future interns and students.

Correct SCELC Shared Print commitments will allow other SCELC libraries to weed their collections with confidence in knowing we are retaining copies of these items.

               As I said at the beginning, we have an amazing staff in the Caltech Library, and they have done a lot of work to grow as a team these past few years. They have leaned into learning new skills, humoring me (at least at first) in team-building activities, and continue to expand the level of service they provide to our community.

                 We’ve done quite a bit of hiring in the last five years! Many of the positions are reconfigurations of existing staff lines but to serve new purposes as the Library evolves, and, even more significantly, many of these positions were filled with internal hires who grew into their new positions by working at Caltech.

                  Strategic Plan AY21-AY23 / AY24-27:
                 </strong>
                 The Caltech Library devised its first Strategic Plan for AY21-AY23 around the key theme of partnership. This plan serves as the foundation for progress at the Caltech Library and establishes future directions to ensure its growth as a premier research library befitting the world-class research institution it serves.

               I feel a little tired after writing that list, but it really only reflects a small portion of what the Caltech Library has achieved! I have enjoyed working with everyone at the Library and across the Caltech campus. It’s truly an extraordinary place to work, and I will miss all of you very much.
