               Richard Thai comes to us from CSUN where he was the ScholarWorks (Repository) Specialist, and he previously held archivist positions at the LA84 Foundation and the National History Museum of Los Angeles County. Richard holds a BA from UC Irvine and a MLIS from UCLA, where he sits on the Information Studies Alumni Association Board. The search committee was struck by Richard’s collaborative work style and his outreach efforts. We asked Richard some questions about his role in this new position.

               <strong>
                Congratulations on your new position as Digital Archivist, Richard! Could you give us an introduction to what a digital archivist does?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you! I am excited to be here at Caltech.
              </p>
              <p>
               The role of a digital archivist can vary from institution to institution. At Caltech, I will be working primarily with “born-digital” materials. As you can guess, that’s materials that were created on a computer and not digitalized from a physical counterpart. So instead of preserving the letters and newspapers, I would be preserving emails and websites. More importantly, I would be developing the policies and workflows for preserving digital content and making them accessible. At other institutions, the digital archivist may also oversee digitalization as well. I am sure there are some “duties as assigned” waiting for me, too.
              </p>

               <strong>
                What inspired you to pursue a career in digital archiving?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The short answer: I like organizing stuff, I have a fondness for history, and I enjoy helping people.
              </p>
              <p>
               The long answer: I thought I wanted to pursue a career in museums but the only department that had an opening was the history department. They had a western history collection that needed processing and the archivist needed help. Like many archivists, getting a taste of working in an archive was what sent me on my archives journey.
              </p>
              <p>
               I did not intentionally set out to be a digital archivist but with things becoming increasingly digital, it is where the exciting new developments in the field are happening.

                What does a day in the life of a digital archivist look like?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               We are currently in process of developing our “born-digital” collection at Caltech and I am in the “training/discovery” phase of the job. This means I am attending training sessions, meeting with Library staff, researching standards/workflows, and testing out different software. Ask me again in a few months and I will have a better answer.

                What are some of the biggest challenges facing digital archivists in 2023?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Digital archiving is a relatively young field, so we do not have a deep history of professional practice to fall back upon. Many of my digital archivist colleagues have told me that they are learning on the job. At the same time, we are not held back by decades old professional dogma and there are a lot of opportunities to be a pioneer in the field. It is daunting but also a very exciting time to be in archives.
              </p>

               <strong>
                What do you anticipate for the future of the Caltech digital archives?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               It will be great. There are a lot of born-digital materials waiting to be collected and processed.

               We are pleased to announce that George Porter will move into the newly formed role of Repository Coordinator at Caltech Library. As the Engineering &amp; Applied Science Librarian, George has worked on our repositories since they were created. However, the Repository Coordinator role formalizes and funds the full-time work required to support and maintain  CaltechAUTHORS as a campus service. We took this opportunity to ask George some questions about his new role and Caltech repositories in general.

                Thank you.  I’m delighted to take on this new role. Repositories are collections of material. In the library world, the four primary types are: subject-based or institutional; textual or data.

                CaltechAUTHORS has been a victim of its own success. Over the course of more than 20 years, the Library has operated the repository with a small team of developers, programmers, and library staff contributing effort as priorities allowed. CaltechAUTHORS has grown to more than 100,000 records and been the source of more than 25 million global file downloads. As the largest trove of scholarly output from any single university, the time had come to provide formal, dedicated oversight for the operation. Fortunately, when the job was posted, I happened to have more than 20 years of relevant experience to offer.

                The next three to six months will see CaltechAUTHORS migrate from the EPrints platform, in continuous use since 2001, to InvenioRDM, the CERN-backed platform which underlies CaltechDATA. With such a large database, there are a great number of issues to consider and fields to map as we prepare to migrate.  As with many services which have developed organically, the metadata standards and collection policies have evolved over time. With a full-time position, it will be possible to focus on establishing a baseline for the metadata, while looking for opportunities to automate ingest and update processes.

               <p>
                The initial impetus for CaltechAUTHORS was to provide free, legally compliant access to as much Caltech scholarship as possible. In 2009, the Faculty Board refocused the Library’s effort to include documenting all of the Institute’s scholarly output, even if legal restrictions prevented the Library from distributing publisher-formatted articles. Fully addressing the Institute’s research output, current and stretching back to Caltech’s beginnings, will require multiple strategies to identify all of the material.

                 Shortly after Jack’s 98th birthday that June, his landmark organic chemistry textbook surpassed 500,000 file downloads from CaltechAUTHORS. The book has continued to be widely read from the Internet and has now been downloaded more than 1.25 million times. His co-author, the late Marjorie Caserio, gave a presentation on the organic chemistry textbook as an Internet phenomenon a few years later at an American Chemical Society meeting in San Francisco.

               Students are expected to attend both days, so please check with your advisor and lab-mates in advance of signing up to make sure they can do without you for that length of time!  Just to note, the Library will check with your advisor to confirm your availability—past experience from our March Bootcamp was that advisors were happy for attendees to participate. We are planning to offer this on a more frequent basis, so your feedback will be sought both during and after the event!

               Caltech Library is pleased to announce that CaltechDATA, our institutional data and software repository, launched a major upgrade on Wednesday September 21, 2022.
              </p>
              <p>
               CaltechDATA has served as critical research infrastructure for campus since 2017, and it hosts over 20,000 records containing datasets and software for a wide variety of disciplines. With this launch, CaltechDATA now runs on the open-source InvenioRDM platform and brings many new features that Caltech researchers have requested:

                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
                 Easier record creation with autocomplete for creators, affiliations, subjects, and funders
                </p>
               </li>
               <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
                 Automatic record versioning
                </p>
               </li>
               <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
                 Private share link for reviewers
                </p>
               </li>
               <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
                <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
                 Improved record views, with dynamic citations and an expanded file previewer
                </p>
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p dir="ltr">
               This version of CaltechDATA also introduces communities, which enable groups at Caltech to create their own record curation and approval processes. Researchers can collect records into a single browse and search interface. A curation pipeline allows records to be submitted by Caltech users, and then approved by a defined set of curators. We’ve pre-seeded a small number of initial communities, and look forward to seeing what researchers create.

               InvenioRDM is a customizable open-source repository platform developed by CERN and twenty partner organizations, including Caltech Library. It is built on the twenty-year history of the Invenio repository platform, whose most-successful implementation is the Zenodo generalist repository hosted by CERN. InvenioRDM takes the features of Zenodo and makes them customizable for institutions. InvenioRDM will enable Caltech Library to more rapidly roll out new features and collaborate with other institutions to establish repository best practices.
