               In mid-June, Phillip Jaffe moved to California right after graduating with his master’s degree in library science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison and assumed his new role as Caltech's Engineering &amp; Applied Science Librarian. He settled in just in time for summer, and we asked him some questions to introduce him to the campus community. Join us in welcoming Phillip to the Library and say hi the next time you're in Sherman Fairchild!

               <strong>
                Congratulations on your new position as our Librarian for Engineering and Applied Science! What appealed to you about this position?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you—I’m so glad to be here. Since pursuing librarianship, it has been my goal to support research in an academic library setting, ideally in a scientific or technical discipline. So I really can’t think of anywhere I’d rather be than here, at an institution dedicated to research excellence that’s constantly at the frontier of scientific knowledge. What I also found appealing was Caltech’s small size—especially compared to other universities with similar research outputs. I imagine this will enhance the human aspect of the job, making it more feasible to maintain working relationships with students, faculty, and staff in the division, and to stay tuned into what individuals are working on.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                During your interview, we were all interested in your internship with the Executive Office of the President. Could you tell us a little about it?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I was very lucky to intern last summer in the Library of the Executive Office of the President in Washington, DC. The library’s mission is to support EOP staff, which includes the staff of the White House Office, in their work for the president of the United States. While the library of course holds all sorts of legal materials and government documents, it also maintains a print collection of popular nonfiction books—covering policy areas and political and presidential history—much like what you would find in a public library. During my internship, I helped to field reference questions from EOP staff, which varied widely in scope. Responding to a request could be as simple as retrieving a newspaper article or recommending some books on a certain issue, or it could be as involved as examining the legislative history of a particular regulation.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                You recently completed your degree in library science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. What are some things that you've learned that you can bring to this new role?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               One course I found to be particularly valuable and enjoyable focused on collection management. Through a series of projects for the course, I got experience evaluating a large collection for content strengths and gaps—and identifying candidate materials for acquisition as well as for removal from the collection. I hope to apply similar skills to ensure that the Caltech Library’s collection stays appropriately tailored to the research being conducted in the EAS division. I was also lucky in that there are many libraries on the UW-Madison campus, so over the course of my time there, I was able to work in a few that specialized in different scientific disciplines.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What do you like about working in libraries? What inspired you to pursue a career as a librarian?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               One short answer is that I like finding stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
               As an undergrad, my favorite part of any research assignment was always getting all my resources together—following trails of bibliographies and navigating physical and digital library spaces to locate anything that might be relevant. It was then that I first floated the possibility of pursuing a career in librarianship and started talking to librarians at my university about their work.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am also very interested in the research process. Although I don’t think I would have it in me to do research myself, I very much like the idea of working in a research-adjacent role, where I can have a broad view of the information lifecycle and of knowledge production in a wider range of disciplines.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lastly, I’d be disingenuous not to mention the lifestyle considerations in my decision to pursue librarianship: A library is a pleasant space in which to pass a workday, and one that I find relatively easy to get out of bed for. There are books around. There’s not a lot of yelling. Hardly ever an emergency. If any career path is mentally sustainable for me, it’s this one.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What are some of your goals, hopes, and/or plans for working with the Division of Engineering and Applied Science?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               My plan is to keep in close contact with the various EAS departments, so that I can stay up to date on the research and education happening throughout the division, and make sure that the library’s collections and services accommodate the division’s needs. I’m also hoping to help uphold this institution’s tradition of benefiting society, by making sure that the knowledge produced in the EAS division is disseminated as widely, and has as great an impact, as possible.

              <p>
               Please join us in welcoming Alvaro Quezada as the Library's new Head of Access and Collection Services! Alvaro is joining us from USC’s Science &amp; Engineering Library where he was a subject librarian. Prior to that position, he was a library supervisor for access services at USC’s Norris Medical Library. He holds a master’s in management in library and information science from USC and a bachelor’s of science in criminal justice from CSULA.
              </p>
              <p>
               With his experience as both a staff member and a supervisor in access services and as a subject librarian for science and engineering, Alvaro has a unique blend of skills and experiences that will benefit ACS and Caltech Library as a whole. Alvaro started on Monday, May 20, and we're grateful that he found some time this week to answer some questions about his new role.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Congratulations on your new position as Head of Access &amp; Collection Services, Alvaro! Could you give us an introduction to what the Access &amp; Collection Services department traditionally handles in a library?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you! The Access &amp; Collection Services department in a library plays a critical role in managing and facilitating user access to library resources. Traditionally, this department encompasses several key functions. For starters, and the most visible to the library community, is Circulation. Circulation manages the lending of library materials and resources to library users and provides frontline support to users, answering questions related to library services, resources, and policies.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another key function is Interlibrary Loan and Document Delivery (ILL). This service allows users to request access to resources that are not owned by their institution. The ILL department will scour the country, if not the world, to provide the user access to the physical or electronic version of the resources they need.
              </p>
              <p>
               Furthermore, Reserve Services and Collection Maintenance are also key functions of the department. Reserve Services manages the course reserves and other high-usage materials. Collection Maintenance ensures that the library’s physical collection is well-organized and accessible to all users.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Can you tell us a little about your previous work at USC?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Absolutely! At USC Libraries, I was a Science and Engineering Librarian as the subject liaison for mathematics, biology, earth sciences, physics, and astronomy. I provided research assistance to students, faculty, and researchers and designed and delivered instructional sessions on information literacy, research strategies, and effective use of library resources.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What are some lessons that you've learned in that position that you can bring to this new role?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               There are several lessons that I have learned as a Science and Engineering Librarian that are going to be extremely beneficial in my new role. Most notably, learning to adapt to new challenges and environments is crucial. Having made the transition from staff to faculty in this role amidst the pandemic meant I had to not only undertake the new responsibilities of the position but determine how to complete these deliverables remotely. This experience is going to be critical in learning how to undertake the responsibilities of a library administrator (a first for me) and familiarizing myself with the various systems and workflows. Another lesson that I will bring to my new role is project management. I quickly learned the nature of the librarian position is heavily projects based. Balancing multiple projects and meeting deadlines provided me with the experience to effectively prioritize tasks, manage time efficiently, and clearly define expectations, all of which are going to be essential in my new role.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What do you like about working in libraries? What inspired you to pursue a career as a library administrator?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               There is an extensive list of the things I find gratifying about working in an academic library. At the top of the list is the intellectual vibrancy and engagement that permeates the campus. These vibes are incredibly contagious and powerful enough to infuse creativity and motivation. Working in an environment that offers this experience every time I arrive on campus is an incredible way to spend my day.
              </p>
              <p>
               The second-best thing I enjoy about working in an academic library is the contribution we make to the academic and professional achievements to our community of students, faculty, staff, and researchers. Whether it is the access to the collection of our resources, our study spaces, research support, or instruction services, in one subtle way (or in some instances, not so subtle ways), we were indispensable to their overall success.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pursuing a career as a library administrator stems from several key motivations. The first being the opportunity to obtain a position of leadership. I have always been passionate about leading teams, setting strategic directions, and managing projects and this position presented that opportunity. In addition, throughout my career, I have been fortunate to work with mentors who demonstrated the importance of effective library leadership. Due to this experience, I have had the opportunity to establish the essential skills necessary to pursue a path where I can foster an environment of empowerment and collaboration and demonstrate to colleagues the same fundamentals.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What are some of your goals, hopes, or plans for the future of the Access &amp; Collection Services department?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The goal for the future of the Access &amp; Collection Services department is to continue reimagining our services, staying at the forefront of best practices, and evaluating emerging technologies to enhance the library experience for the Caltech community. In essence, to commit ourselves to the pursuit of academic excellence that is synonymous with the reputation of Caltech.
              </p>
              <p>
               In terms of the wonderful folks in the Access &amp; Collection Services department, my plans are to support their professional growth, and contribute to creating a positive and motivating atmosphere that promotes collaboration and appreciation of each contributing team member.
              </p>

               The Caltech Library is happy to announce that, as of April 8, Paula Gaetos is our new Programming and Student Engagement Librarian!
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               Paula joined Caltech Library in 2018 as Information Services Generalist Assistant, previously working as a library clerk at school and public libraries. During her time at the Library, Paula has made significant contributions to the TechHub, the Library's Events &amp; Programming Committee, and Library signage. In December 2022, she completed her master’s degree in library and information science from San Jose State University. We are pleased that she agreed to answer some questions about her new role.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                1) Congratulations on your new position, Paula! Could you give us an introduction to what a Programming &amp; Student Engagement Librarian does?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks! I’m really grateful and honored to take on this new role at the Library. A Programming &amp; Student Engagement Librarian is responsible for developing and implementing library programming and events that support our students’ engagement and success at Caltech, particularly for our undergraduate and historically underrepresented students.
              </p>
              <p>
               It can be events like our Outdoor Movie Nights or Craft-a-Mole for Mole Day that provide a space to hang out and decompress with other students. It can also be developing outreach initiatives, like tabling at campus events or hosting workshops, to help demystify accessing and utilizing library resources so our students are well equipped to reach their learning and research goals.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                2) What are some of the developments in the Library that created the need for this new position?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The biggest development in the Library was formalizing our mission statement and strategic plan. By expressing our values and commitment to inclusive practices and prioritizing campus partnership and collaborations, it generated the momentum to develop initiatives that reflected those statements.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               So in 2021, when our students and campus community returned to campus in full capacity, we picked up on the need for everyone to acclimate and reconnect with campus resources and with each other. This led to the formation of the Events and Programming Committee. Since then, we've been developing and assessing what library events and programming were implemented before and how to redevelop them to suit our students’ current needs in order to foster belonging and familiarity, like the TechHub open house or creating cultural heritage celebratory displays. We happily saw an overall increase in library resource usage and a number of first-time participants in library events as a result, especially from undergraduates.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               With such a positive response and growing interest in its development, it was clear this kind of outreach was an integral part of our Library services and required a dedicated role.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                3) What will a day in the life of the Programming &amp; Student Engagement Librarian look like?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               We’re just getting started, so I can’t really say for sure what would be typical, but I anticipate my workload involves a lot of planning ahead. So my day may simply start with staring at a four-month white board calendar and the annual events calendar to see what needs to be prepared for upcoming events.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               It could mean connecting with the undergraduate office about their anticipated plans for next year’s new student welcome week or prepping “outreach boxes,” which are simply the mailboxes we fill with outreach materials, like flyers, stickers, and free pencils to bring to tabling events, like the DiscoTech resource fair happening this month.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                4) You've previously been the co-chair of the Events and Programming Committee. What are some lessons that you've learned in that leadership position that you can bring to this new role?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The most important lesson was to allow space to say no and adapt to that boundary. EPCOM is a small and mighty team who found themselves at one point creating and participating in at least five events per term. When we laid out an annual events calendar that anticipated regular events like Ditch Day or holidays, like Lunar New Year, it’s possible to have up to ten events per term. April itself has #Gaypril, National Library Week, and Earth Week in addition to 3MT, DiscoTech, and Grad Student Appreciation Week.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               It'll be easy to be ambitious and participate in all of them simply because this work is truly interesting and a well-done event is fun and satisfying to put together. It’s also a way to burn out a team’s energy and engagement in the long run.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               By allowing the space to assess, prioritize, and delegate which events we participate in—being able to say no—we’re able to keep the creative energy to develop something new or improve on what we’ve done before.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                5) What will you be able to do with programming and student engagement now that you can give them your full attention?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The Library absolutely has a role to play in creating a safe and engaging campus to support our students academically and holistically. So my hope is that we’re able to formalize our signature programming and events that center the Library as a third space for our campus community.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               In addition, my biggest challenge is to be able to measure the Library’s impact and value to our students during their years here at Caltech. So as part of formalizing signature programming and events, I want to focus on creating programming assessments so we can document and communicate that impact in a really meaningful way.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                6) What are some things we can look forward to in the future of Caltech Library events and programming?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               In the short-term, newer and different free snack options during Stress Free Library events. I would love to get more of our students’ opinions on what they like to snack on while studying.

               In the long-term, I really look forward to working with everyone in the Library to brainstorm utilizing all our Library spaces to host events, like the maker projects at the TechHub. I also really hope to connect more with other departments on campus for future events, especially for New Student Welcome Week.

               The Caltech Library is sad to say farewell to Head of Access &amp; Collection Services Franses Rodriguez this week, but Franses has a bright future ahead in her new position as Deputy Director of Research Libraries at the New York Public Library. When Franses came to the Library four years ago, we asked her some questions and

               . We followed up with similar questions this week on the eve of her departure. (Franses is pictured above 1) left with Viet Nguyen, Reserves &amp; Circulation Supervisor, and Benjamin Maggio, Document Delivery/Interlibrary Loan Support Staff and 2) right at her farewell party with University Librarian Kara Whatley and other staff.)

              </p>
              <p>
               In terms of responsibilities, I oversee the strategy and goals of the Research Libraries, ensuring accountability for strategic initiatives. I will manage select cross-library projects and collaborate with key partners outside the Research Library divisions (Mellon Director on donor relationships and fundraising opportunities, Finance Department, Strategy and Public Impact team, Human Resources, Capital Planning, and Communications &amp; Marketing teams) to ensure their successful execution. I will be expected to lead Research All Staff, Cabinet, and other meetings in order to contribute to the direction and morale of the team.

                In our previous interview when you arrived at Caltech in June 2020, I asked you what you liked about working in libraries. What did you specifically enjoy about working for the Caltech Library?

              </p>
              <p>
               The people I worked with and Access and Collections Services' dedication to IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility) was key in my daily motivation. My ACS colleagues (Phuong, Laurel, Bianca, Mel, Dan, Ben P., Ben M., Viet, Paula, Becky, Ling, Rebecca, Andy, and Kris) exemplified true teamwork, overcoming personal and professional differences. Their intentions, always rooted in understanding their triggers and their desire to provide the best services possible, significantly influenced our work, the team, and our patrons. They were an absolute dream to work with. The next department head will be VERY fortunate. The Library leadership team (Donna, Catherine, Stephen, and Peter) provided me with such a rich learning environment and a safe space for collaboration. Together, we tackled challenging goals, supported each other daily, and made a meaningful impact. I'll deeply miss our discussions.
              </p>
              <p>
               Kara's mentorship was transformative, giving my ideas a platform and guiding me towards a lifelong commitment to librarianship. Her influence reshaped my career path, I will especially miss her guidance.

                When you started at the Library, we were all remote! Looking back, how did that auspicious beginning influence your transition to Caltech? What did you learn about working at Caltech that influenced your time at the Library once we all returned to in-person services?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Remote work taught me the importance of face-to-face interactions in building successful relationships. Despite the challenges, consistent and effective use of virtual platforms like Zoom facilitated progress and helped maintain connections during the lockdown. Meeting colleagues in person after virtual interactions bridged the gap swiftly, which really supported our collaboration.

               The mission of Caltech Archives and Special Collections is to facilitate understanding of Caltech's role in the history of science and technology and of the research and lives of its community. Earlier this fall, the Archives conducted a search for an Archival Processing Intern to assist with surveying, arranging, and describing physical and digital records held at the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories (GALCIT), Division of Engineering and Applied Science.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) was a research institute created in 1926, at first specializing in aeronautics research. In 1930, Hungarian scientist Theodore von Karman accepted the directorship of the lab and emigrated to the United States. Under his leadership, work on rockets began there in 1936. In 1961 the name changed to Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories at the California Institute of Technology. In 2006 GALCIT was once again renamed, taking on the new and current name of Graduate Aerospace Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology (while continuing to maintain the acronym GALCIT) in order to reflect its vigorous re-engagement with space engineering and with JPL.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the conclusion of the search, DiAndra Reyes was chosen to be our new GALCIT Archival Processing Intern. She is a second year Master of Library and Information Science student at San José State University. DiAndra agreed to answer some questions so we could get to know her better.

               <strong>
                Hi DiAndra! We're happy to welcome you as the Library's new Archival Processing Intern. This position was funded by the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories (GALCIT) and you were chosen from many qualified candidates. What drew you to apply to this position?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Hello! I am truly honored to have been selected as the new GALCIT Processing Intern. Firstly, I want to thank GALCIT, Caltech Library, and Archives for giving me such an amazing professional development opportunity. There were many factors that drew me to this position. One of my motivating factors for applying was that I felt really aligned with the Caltech Archives’ focus on facilitating an understanding of Caltech’s pivotal role in the history of science and technology. I really got a sense from the job posting, as well as talking to Mariella Soprano and Kara Whatley in the interview, that the Archives and Institute really care about the preservation and discovery of its history and people, while at the same time they have a forward-looking approach to doing archival work.
              </p>
              <p>
               Although I do not have a background in Aerospace Engineering, the chance to immerse myself in a subject area with which I am less familiar adds an enriching dimension to the experience and gives me a unique opportunity to become a more versatile and collaborative archivist who can adapt to any field. Furthermore, I’ve been in the San José State University Master of Library and Information Science online program for two and a half years, and the opportunity to work on-site, get hands-on experience with the physical materials, and build interpersonal relationships with the staff and faculty, really enticed me.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What kind of courses are you currently taking in the MLIS program at San José State?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I’m currently taking an Archives Reference class, where I’m learning about reference processes, guidelines, legalities, etc. in archival institutions. Additionally, I am also doing a fall semester internship at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles, which I will be receiving school credit for.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Now that you've started working in the Archives, what does a typical day in the life of a GALCIT Archival Processing Intern look like?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               A typical day for me involves arriving at my office in the Guggenheim building at 9 a.m. Mariella Soprano, my supervisor, meets me there around the same time. I first check my calendar and emails to confirm what meetings I have for the day. Then I start working with Mariella in going through materials. We work together to decide what to keep and what to throw away, as well as conducting some basic preservation procedures like removing rusty staples and clips and flattening out papers. Then we figure out how to categorize and organize the materials into series and subseries. I input the data for the materials into a spreadsheet with titles, dates, creators, scope and content notes, etc. This spreadsheet will later be imported into ArchivesSpace. Next, I put the materials in archival folders and in their respective sections on shelves in my office. Sometimes, I also spend part of my day researching GALCIT and its history. The GALCIT website and the Caltech Archives’ oral histories website have served as valuable resources in understanding the context of the materials we are discovering.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What can you tell us about the Archives you're working on?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The GALCIT archives is a treasure trove of materials dating from the 1930s and 1940s through the present, consisting of records from the department’s initiatives and projects. It’s really a Pandora’s box, and we have still yet to know what we will find. So far, we know there are papers, large plans and drawings, and audio/visual materials. The commitment of the GALCIT department in taking the initiative to preserve all this history is truly commendable. The collection will be stored in GALCIT, in the basement of the Firestone building, while under the guardianship of the Archives department.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What do you enjoy so far about working at Caltech?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Working at Caltech has been an enriching experience so far, particularly due to the opportunity to interact with diverse individuals at GALCIT, the Archives, and the Library. Learning from passionate professionals who are doing amazing work has been truly inspiring. I hope to continue learning as much as I can about how each department functions and their impacts on the Caltech community as a whole.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Is there anything you'd like us to know before we go?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I would like to express my gratitude for the warm welcome from everyone and the opportunity to be a part of the Caltech community. I look forward to sharing our discoveries of the GALCIT collection in the near future!
