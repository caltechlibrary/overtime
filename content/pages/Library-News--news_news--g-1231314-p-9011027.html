               Jo Krajeski and Benjamin Mendez Jr. worked as Archival Processing Interns this past spring and summer in the Caltech Archives and Special Collections processing the David L. Goodstein and the Judith R. Goodstein papers. This is the first time the Archives brought in two interns to collaboratively work in the archives. The Goodsteins both spent many hours in the Archives working and researching Caltech’s history, so it was fitting to have both collections successively processed. Both David’s and Judith’s collections are now both fully organized and accessible in the reading room.

               Collections and Metadata Archivist Penny Neder-Muro asked Jo and Benjamin some questions about their experiences as MLIS students and their time working as interns in the Caltech Archives.

                Thank you, Jo and Benjamin, for speaking with us today. You are both enrolled in San Jose State University’s Master of Library and Information Science fully online program. What drew you to pursue the MLIS degree?  And how has that program prepared you for this internship?

               My experience as an intern for the CSULB Center for the History of Video Games, Technology, and Critical Play drew me to enroll in the SJSU MLIS program. I enjoy information in general and its importance to people. During my time in SJSU’s program, I have learned tons about the LIS field, including archives. One course that helped a lot was a course called Archives and Manuscripts. This course reviewed the importance of archives as information spaces and how to be a successful archivist.

               Genealogy and a growing love for researching historical events inspired me to pursue an MLIS at SJSU. I have been studying archival and library science for a while now (my bachelor’s degree is also LIS focused), so I am well-educated but had little practical experience. I jumped at the chance to work in the Caltech Archives. I also hoped to gain smarts through osmosis.

               I had the privilege of appraising and organizing the collections of both David and Judith R Goodstein. Depending on the day my tasks included: applying basic preservation measures to rehouse the paper materials, moving them to acid-free folders/boxes, and organizing items alphabetically, chronologically or by subject. Once the collection order was determined, we created collection guides for researchers to quickly and easily locate the information sought within their collections. It was interesting to learn what was in a collection, which determined the best way to organize it and make it accessible to archives researchers.

My day-to-day included arriving at the archive around 7:30 am till 12:30 pm, Monday only for the beginning of my internship, then after that; it sped up once summer began. Jo and I used a shared spreadsheet, and we communicated a lot about which organization made the most sense.

                David Goodstein was a member of the Caltech Faculty from 1968 through 2007, as Frank J. Gilloon Distinguished Teaching and Service Professor, who taught physics and served as Vice-Provost for almost twenty years.

               He had a great sense of humor, which is strange to say about someone you have never met except on paper. He was also a very curious person, a great admirer (and friend) of Richard Feynman, and he formed strong lasting friendships with colleagues and others within his profession. I was very impressed by his ability and determination to learn Italian after he accepted an NSF fellowship in Rome. He would not only learn to communicate with his fellow lab team, but he would give seminars solely in Italian. I have great respect for David Goodstein.

               I guess what surprises me the most about working in archives in general is the number of ways actions can be performed; there is no one way to do any task, but the outcome is the same: to provide access to the collections. I didn’t quite know what to expect from the Caltech Archives and Special collections, but I learned there is more interesting history to be found within their stacks than I ever realized.

               Of the many important things I learned this summer, one that will stick with me is that every collection is different, and depending on the circumstances, decisions can change; as Penny would say, “It depends.” While archives have standards set in place, every day could be different, and sometimes exceptions are made. A lot depends on donor agreements and the information being processed, such as medical records or classified materials.

               Ultimately, my goal is to remain in the archival field, but I am open to anywhere in the LIS field. I have really enjoyed my time working in an academic environment, but my passion lies with genealogy so maybe a state or local archive, or something along those lines. Working with NARA would be an accomplishment.

               After graduation, I plan to work in an academic library or in an archives. If I take the librarian route, I would love to work at a community college or CSU in either an education or systems librarian role. If I go with the archivist route, I would love to work in an archive revolving around technology and video games. With only a year left in my MLIS, I am anxious but excited for what will come. The road will be tough, but I am ready for the challenge!

               This experience has been amazing. I have learned so much and felt so welcomed by the archives staff (and by extension the library crew) from my arrival to departure. I was given several learning opportunities, such as helping with reference, that helped with my coursework and gave me the hands-on experience I desired. I feel prepared to embark on other adventures and hope the archives’ staff continue to share their wisdom with future interns and students.

                 Each term we turn Sherman Fairchild Library, aka SFL, into the Stress Free Library during midterms and finals. SFL provides twenty-four hour study space and services to all Caltech students along with evening snacks and hot water, puzzle breaks, visits from the Huntington Hospital Pet Assisted Therapy volunteers (“the puppies”), our soundscape study and retreat room, and much more. We also sneak a little stress reduction in over the late spring, all summer, and early fall with our SFL Amphitheater outdoor movie nights.

                 </strong>
                 The Caltech Archives was awarded a grant to prepare for the next edition of the region-wide arts initiative Pacific Standard Time: Art x Science x L.A., scheduled to open in 2024. Caltech is one of 45 cultural, educational, and scientific institutions throughout Southern California to receive support from the Getty Foundation for their projects, all of which will explore the intersection of art and science.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The Caltech Archives’ project, “Crossing Over: Art &amp; Science at Caltech, 1920-2020,” will tell stories from Caltech’s 133 years of using art and images in science and engineering research, science communication, and building campus community.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Pacific Standard Time: Art x Science x L.A. will include dozens of simultaneous exhibitions and programs focused on the intertwined histories of art and science, past and present, that together address some of the most complex challenges of the 21st century—from climate change and environmental racism to the current pandemic and artificial intelligence—and the creative solutions these problems demand.

               The running joke around the Caltech Library is that I’ve never met a project I didn’t like, and there is some truth to that. Over the past five years, we’ve migrated all of our back-end library systems and implemented a few new systems solutions, such as ARES, our online course reserves tool that is linked to Caltech’s Canvas courses. Below are a few of the behind-the-scenes projects we’ve done to help bring a better library experience to the Caltech community.

                 After much research and deliberation, the Caltech Library adopted the FOLIO Library Services Platform (LSP) for use starting in the fall 2021 term. FOLIO, which stands for the Future of Libraries Is Open, is “an open-source project supported by many academic libraries worldwide, and a number of commercial vendors, including EBSCO. EBSCO contributes substantially to the technical development of FOLIO software and offers FOLIO hosting and data management services.” FOLIO offers our patrons a more integrated library search experience.

                 As part of our new system of RFID (radio frequency identification) tagging, we conducted a collection inventory. In addition to confirming what’s on our shelves, the completion of this project means that we can reconcile our holdings with OCLC, helping DocuServe be a better interlibrary loan lending partner and allowing us to update our SCELC Shared Print commitments. Correct SCELC Shared Print commitments will allow other SCELC libraries to weed their collections with confidence in knowing we are retaining copies of these items.

               This July, George Porter is retiring from his work at the Caltech Library after 27 years. George started at the Library as the Engineering and Applied Science Librarian in summer 1997 and then became our inaugural Repository Coordinator in spring 2023. George contributed so much during his time at the Library that we asked him to reminisce about some of the highlights on the eve of his departure. We will miss George very much and we're happy to share his top 10 adventures in librarianship.

                1)
               </strong>
               Being in the right place at the right time—following a brief career in reference publishing, I completed my MSLS at Columbia University. I went to North Carolina State University Libraries in 1991. By 1993-94, I was chairing both NCSU and the Triangle Research Libraries Network OPAC working groups as we sought to implement the next generation integrated library system from DRA.
              </p>
              <p>
               The First International WAIS Conference was hosted at the Research Triangle Institute during this period, bringing Brewster Kahle, Paul Evan Peters, Tim Berners-Lee, and Cliff Lynch to town. This proved to be the only international WAIS conference.
              </p>
              <p>
               Brewster Kahle would sell WAIS, Inc. to AOL in 1995. And the experimental system Berners-Lee demonstrated with a NeXT workstation at that conference, the World Wide Web, would rapidly supplant Gopher as the predominant technology for finding and reading material on the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
               The menuing system I designed for NCSU to provide access to the new online catalog, the HYTELNET global directory of library catalogs, and access to a variety of locally hosted literature index databases (Medline, Agricola, MLA Bibliography) would be implemented in HTML and accessed using the text-based Lynx web browser.
              </p>

                2)
               </strong>
               At NCSU Libraries, I was the engineering reference librarian and coordinator of online searching. In the era of dial-up access to commercially hosted databases, mediated searching was the norm. Database searching was expensive. Special academic rates were available for searching after 5:00 p.m. I spent many an early evening doing database searches in Chemical Abstracts, INSPEC, and Engineering Index, for luminescence spectra data (electro-, photo-, chemi-) of a wide variety of III-V semiconductor compounds, especially III-V nitrides. This Army Research Office funded research gave rise to Cree Semiconductors’ white LEDs.
              </p>
              <p>
               At Caltech Library, which I joined in 1997, I tackled some challenging reference questions:

               <strong>
                3)
               </strong>
               An interlibrary loan request came in looking for a Bible that was published with a detailed timeline from Creation to the present day, which is to say, only a handful of years after Gutenberg invented the printing press. A few hours of research identified such a volume, but not one which could be borrowed through interlibrary lending. Fortunately, the professor understood that having the book brought to campus was not in the cards. He was delighted to have it identified so that he could consult and examine it at the Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens.
              </p>

               </strong>
               When Prof. Fred Culick was asked to speak at the Reagan Library’s dedication ceremony of the installation of the retired Boeing 707 which had served as Air Force One for seven presidents, he wanted to show a photo of the first time a US President had flown in an airplane. Knowing that the Smithsonian Institution had digitized thousands of historic photos in the mid-1990s, I was able to email a link to a photo of Theodore Roosevelt preparing to take flight in St. Louis in 1910 before Prof. Culick returned to his office.

               Interlibrary loan questions were never referred to the subject librarians until the DocuServe staff had exhausted all likely avenues of research. One ILL request I worked on took more than six months to fulfill.  The request was for materials property data for Parthenon marble. The information had appeared in a special issue of a periodical published by the engineering school at the University of Thessaloniki. In the end, I received a complete copy of the special issue through the postal service.

               In January 2001, I was asked to visit the ALA Midwinter exhibits to check on a vendor offering ILL automation software. Pigasys (yes, it was a play on Pegasus) proved to be vaporware, but a neighboring booth hosted Atlas Systems, which were trying to start a similar business with ILLiad. I took news of ILLiad and the developers' contact information back to Caltech.

              <p>
               I had worked with Sandy Garstang, head of access services, and Betsy Coles, software developer, in the fall of 2000 to create a local ILL webform to replace the ubiquitous document delivery request forms. ILLiad was designed for requesting returnables (books) and nonreturnables (photocopies of articles or chapters).
              </p>
              <p>
               Caltech Library System had a very high traffic level, including document delivery for materials held by the library. In developing our local webform, we had mapped out the metadata needed to efficiently process journal articles, books, book chapters, conference papers, theses, and standards. The critical innovation was wedding the detailed CLS metadata schema with ILLiad.

              <p>
               The Atlas staff spent parts of February and March 2001 ensconced in the basement of Sherman Fairchild Library, working the more detailed Caltech Library metadata schema into their system which would execute automated lookups for material in the local catalog and in the national OCLC ILL service.

               Caltech’s electronic thesis program got off to a somewhat bumpy start. The Library invited Ed Fox, the electronic thesis pioneer and CS professor at Virginia Tech, to campus for a one-day symposium on electronic theses during spring break 2000. Arden Albee, the Graduate Dean, was quite taken with the possibilities, but became emeritus that summer. Library communication with the Grad Office broke down for a while.
              </p>
              <p>
               The next Graduate Dean, Rod Kiewiet, was a regular participant in the Environmental Quality Lab discussions on Tuesday mornings in which I often participated. I broached the possibility with Rod of pitching an electronic thesis program to the Graduate Studies Committee. I made that pitch during spring term 2002 and received the unanimous approval of the GSC. Dean Kiewiet stepped down from the office in summer 2002.
              </p>
              <p>
               With a go-ahead from the GSC, voluntary deposit of electronic theses began for the class of 2002 with a requirement to be implemented for PhDs beginning with the class of 2003. I worked with Michael Hoffmann as Graduate Dean to roll out the mandatory electronic thesis requirement.

               OpenURL linking has become so ingrained in the digital library age that it may be hard to remember when it didn’t exist. The Santa Fe Convention of the Open Archives Initiative in October 1999 led to two fundamental protocols that form the bedrock of digital libraries: OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative–Protocol  for Metadata Harvesting) and OpenURL linking. Eric Van de Velde, Caltech Library’s Director of Library Information Technology, was a participant in the Santa Fe Convention and chaired the NISO committee for OpenURL 1.0 (Z39.88).

              <p>
               Caltech Library became the North American launch partner with Ex Libris to introduce the first commercial implementation of OpenURL, SFX. My contribution in this innovation was hosting a session of RUSA MARS Hot Topics (American Library Association’s Reference and User Services Association, Machine Assisted Reference Section) focusing on OpenURL at the ALA Annual Meeting in San Francisco in June 2001.
              </p>

               Library conferences are not usually known for crowd control issues. The fire marshals at SF’s Moscone Convention Center came to the 90-minute session twice to clear the people sitting on the floor and standing in the hall outside of the meeting room. With a live demonstration of the technology and representatives from Ex Libris and the NISO committee on the panel, the 75-seat room was inadequate for the 200 or so librarians trying to attend. Internet connections in convention center meeting rooms were extraordinarily rare in 2001, in part because they were prohibitively expensive. It was $1000 well spent!

               I spent a great deal of time exploring the world of free academic electronic journals in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The CLS Online Journal Database (OJDB), implemented by Ed Sponsler, CLS software developer, and curated by me, provided a ready home to document the titles and extent of access. The OJDB permitted the Library to track click-throughs, giving us insight into:

                Congratulations on your new position as our Librarian for Engineering and Applied Science! What appealed to you about this position?

              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you—I’m so glad to be here. Since pursuing librarianship, it has been my goal to support research in an academic library setting, ideally in a scientific or technical discipline. So I really can’t think of anywhere I’d rather be than here, at an institution dedicated to research excellence that’s constantly at the frontier of scientific knowledge. What I also found appealing was Caltech’s small size—especially compared to other universities with similar research outputs. I imagine this will enhance the human aspect of the job, making it more feasible to maintain working relationships with students, faculty, and staff in the division, and to stay tuned into what individuals are working on.
              </p>

               <strong>
                During your interview, we were all interested in your internship with the Executive Office of the President. Could you tell us a little about it?

              </p>
              <p>
               I was very lucky to intern last summer in the Library of the Executive Office of the President in Washington, DC. The library’s mission is to support EOP staff, which includes the staff of the White House Office, in their work for the president of the United States. While the library of course holds all sorts of legal materials and government documents, it also maintains a print collection of popular nonfiction books—covering policy areas and political and presidential history—much like what you would find in a public library. During my internship, I helped to field reference questions from EOP staff, which varied widely in scope. Responding to a request could be as simple as retrieving a newspaper article or recommending some books on a certain issue, or it could be as involved as examining the legislative history of a particular regulation.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                You recently completed your degree in library science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. What are some things that you've learned that you can bring to this new role?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               One course I found to be particularly valuable and enjoyable focused on collection management. Through a series of projects for the course, I got experience evaluating a large collection for content strengths and gaps—and identifying candidate materials for acquisition as well as for removal from the collection. I hope to apply similar skills to ensure that the Caltech Library’s collection stays appropriately tailored to the research being conducted in the EAS division. I was also lucky in that there are many libraries on the UW-Madison campus, so over the course of my time there, I was able to work in a few that specialized in different scientific disciplines.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What do you like about working in libraries? What inspired you to pursue a career as a librarian?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               One short answer is that I like finding stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
               As an undergrad, my favorite part of any research assignment was always getting all my resources together—following trails of bibliographies and navigating physical and digital library spaces to locate anything that might be relevant. It was then that I first floated the possibility of pursuing a career in librarianship and started talking to librarians at my university about their work.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am also very interested in the research process. Although I don’t think I would have it in me to do research myself, I very much like the idea of working in a research-adjacent role, where I can have a broad view of the information lifecycle and of knowledge production in a wider range of disciplines.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lastly, I’d be disingenuous not to mention the lifestyle considerations in my decision to pursue librarianship: A library is a pleasant space in which to pass a workday, and one that I find relatively easy to get out of bed for. There are books around. There’s not a lot of yelling. Hardly ever an emergency. If any career path is mentally sustainable for me, it’s this one.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What are some of your goals, hopes, and/or plans for working with the Division of Engineering and Applied Science?

              </p>
              <p>
               My plan is to keep in close contact with the various EAS departments, so that I can stay up to date on the research and education happening throughout the division, and make sure that the library’s collections and services accommodate the division’s needs. I’m also hoping to help uphold this institution’s tradition of benefiting society, by making sure that the knowledge produced in the EAS division is disseminated as widely, and has as great an impact, as possible.
