               This message will be my final greeting as Caltech’s university librarian, and I would like to take a moment to reflect on what the Library has accomplished in the last five years. The Caltech Library staff, including the Caltech Archives &amp; Special Collections, are an amazing team dedicated to supporting the mission of the Institute, and I have been privileged to work with all of them. I am proud of what we have accomplished together, and I know they are, too.

                 The Caltech Archives was awarded a grant to prepare for the next edition of the region-wide arts initiative Pacific Standard Time: Art x Science x L.A., scheduled to open in 2024. Caltech is one of 45 cultural, educational, and scientific institutions throughout Southern California to receive support from the Getty Foundation for their projects, all of which will explore the intersection of art and science.

                 <br/>
                 The Caltech Archives’ project, “Crossing Over: Art &amp; Science at Caltech, 1920-2020,” will tell stories from Caltech’s 133 years of using art and images in science and engineering research, science communication, and building campus community.

                 <br/>
                 Pacific Standard Time: Art x Science x L.A. will include dozens of simultaneous exhibitions and programs focused on the intertwined histories of art and science, past and present, that together address some of the most complex challenges of the 21st century—from climate change and environmental racism to the current pandemic and artificial intelligence—and the creative solutions these problems demand.

               The running joke around the Caltech Library is that I’ve never met a project I didn’t like, and there is some truth to that. Over the past five years, we’ve migrated all of our back-end library systems and implemented a few new systems solutions, such as ARES, our online course reserves tool that is linked to Caltech’s Canvas courses. Below are a few of the behind-the-scenes projects we’ve done to help bring a better library experience to the Caltech community.

                 After much research and deliberation, the Caltech Library adopted the FOLIO Library Services Platform (LSP) for use starting in the fall 2021 term. FOLIO, which stands for the Future of Libraries Is Open, is “an open-source project supported by many academic libraries worldwide, and a number of commercial vendors, including EBSCO. EBSCO contributes substantially to the technical development of FOLIO software and offers FOLIO hosting and data management services.” FOLIO offers our patrons a more integrated library search experience.

In addition to confirming what’s on our shelves, the completion of this project means that we can reconcile our holdings with OCLC, helping DocuServe be a better interlibrary loan lending partner and allowing us to update our SCELC Shared Print commitments. Correct SCELC Shared Print commitments will allow other SCELC libraries to weed their collections with confidence in knowing we are retaining copies of these items.

               This July, George Porter is retiring from his work at the Caltech Library after 27 years. George started at the Library as the Engineering and Applied Science Librarian in summer 1997 and then became our inaugural Repository Coordinator in spring 2023. George contributed so much during his time at the Library that we asked him to reminisce about some of the highlights on the eve of his departure. We will miss George very much and we're happy to share his top 10 adventures in librarianship.

               </strong>
               Being in the right place at the right time—following a brief career in reference publishing, I completed my MSLS at Columbia University. I went to North Carolina State University Libraries in 1991. By 1993-94, I was chairing both NCSU and the Triangle Research Libraries Network OPAC working groups as we sought to implement the next generation integrated library system from DRA.
              </p>
              <p>
               The First International WAIS Conference was hosted at the Research Triangle Institute during this period, bringing Brewster Kahle, Paul Evan Peters, Tim Berners-Lee, and Cliff Lynch to town. This proved to be the only international WAIS conference.
              </p>
              <p>
               Brewster Kahle would sell WAIS, Inc. to AOL in 1995. And the experimental system Berners-Lee demonstrated with a NeXT workstation at that conference, the World Wide Web, would rapidly supplant Gopher as the predominant technology for finding and reading material on the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
               The menuing system I designed for NCSU to provide access to the new online catalog, the HYTELNET global directory of library catalogs, and access to a variety of locally hosted literature index databases (Medline, Agricola, MLA Bibliography) would be implemented in HTML and accessed using the text-based Lynx web browser.
              </p>

               </strong>
               At NCSU Libraries, I was the engineering reference librarian and coordinator of online searching. In the era of dial-up access to commercially hosted databases, mediated searching was the norm. Database searching was expensive. Special academic rates were available for searching after 5:00 p.m. I spent many an early evening doing database searches in Chemical Abstracts, INSPEC, and Engineering Index, for luminescence spectra data (electro-, photo-, chemi-) of a wide variety of III-V semiconductor compounds, especially III-V nitrides. This Army Research Office funded research gave rise to Cree Semiconductors’ white LEDs.
              </p>
              <p>
               At Caltech Library, which I joined in 1997, I tackled some challenging reference questions:

               An interlibrary loan request came in looking for a Bible that was published with a detailed timeline from Creation to the present day, which is to say, only a handful of years after Gutenberg invented the printing press. A few hours of research identified such a volume, but not one which could be borrowed through interlibrary lending. Fortunately, the professor understood that having the book brought to campus was not in the cards. He was delighted to have it identified so that he could consult and examine it at the Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens.

               When Prof. Fred Culick was asked to speak at the Reagan Library’s dedication ceremony of the installation of the retired Boeing 707 which had served as Air Force One for seven presidents, he wanted to show a photo of the first time a US President had flown in an airplane. Knowing that the Smithsonian Institution had digitized thousands of historic photos in the mid-1990s, I was able to email a link to a photo of Theodore Roosevelt preparing to take flight in St. Louis in 1910 before Prof. Culick returned to his office.

               </strong>
               Interlibrary loan questions were never referred to the subject librarians until the DocuServe staff had exhausted all likely avenues of research. One ILL request I worked on took more than six months to fulfill.  The request was for materials property data for Parthenon marble. The information had appeared in a special issue of a periodical published by the engineering school at the University of Thessaloniki. In the end, I received a complete copy of the special issue through the postal service.
              </p>
              <p>

               </strong>
               In January 2001, I was asked to visit the ALA Midwinter exhibits to check on a vendor offering ILL automation software. Pigasys (yes, it was a play on Pegasus) proved to be vaporware, but a neighboring booth hosted Atlas Systems, which were trying to start a similar business with ILLiad. I took news of ILLiad and the developers' contact information back to Caltech.
              </p>
              <p>
               I had worked with Sandy Garstang, head of access services, and Betsy Coles, software developer, in the fall of 2000 to create a local ILL webform to replace the ubiquitous document delivery request forms. ILLiad was designed for requesting returnables (books) and nonreturnables (photocopies of articles or chapters).
              </p>
              <p>
               Caltech Library System had a very high traffic level, including document delivery for materials held by the library. In developing our local webform, we had mapped out the metadata needed to efficiently process journal articles, books, book chapters, conference papers, theses, and standards. The critical innovation was wedding the detailed CLS metadata schema with ILLiad.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Atlas staff spent parts of February and March 2001 ensconced in the basement of Sherman Fairchild Library, working the more detailed Caltech Library metadata schema into their system which would execute automated lookups for material in the local catalog and in the national OCLC ILL service.

               Caltech’s electronic thesis program got off to a somewhat bumpy start. The Library invited Ed Fox, the electronic thesis pioneer and CS professor at Virginia Tech, to campus for a one-day symposium on electronic theses during spring break 2000. Arden Albee, the Graduate Dean, was quite taken with the possibilities, but became emeritus that summer. Library communication with the Grad Office broke down for a while.
              </p>
              <p>
               The next Graduate Dean, Rod Kiewiet, was a regular participant in the Environmental Quality Lab discussions on Tuesday mornings in which I often participated. I broached the possibility with Rod of pitching an electronic thesis program to the Graduate Studies Committee. I made that pitch during spring term 2002 and received the unanimous approval of the GSC. Dean Kiewiet stepped down from the office in summer 2002.
              </p>
              <p>
               With a go-ahead from the GSC, voluntary deposit of electronic theses began for the class of 2002 with a requirement to be implemented for PhDs beginning with the class of 2003. I worked with Michael Hoffmann as Graduate Dean to roll out the mandatory electronic thesis requirement.

               OpenURL linking has become so ingrained in the digital library age that it may be hard to remember when it didn’t exist. The Santa Fe Convention of the Open Archives Initiative in October 1999 led to two fundamental protocols that form the bedrock of digital libraries: OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative–Protocol  for Metadata Harvesting) and OpenURL linking. Eric Van de Velde, Caltech Library’s Director of Library Information Technology, was a participant in the Santa Fe Convention and chaired the NISO committee for OpenURL 1.0 (Z39.88).
              </p>
              <p>
               Caltech Library became the North American launch partner with Ex Libris to introduce the first commercial implementation of OpenURL, SFX. My contribution in this innovation was hosting a session of RUSA MARS Hot Topics (American Library Association’s Reference and User Services Association, Machine Assisted Reference Section) focusing on OpenURL at the ALA Annual Meeting in San Francisco in June 2001.
              </p>
              <p>
               Library conferences are not usually known for crowd control issues. The fire marshals at SF’s Moscone Convention Center came to the 90-minute session twice to clear the people sitting on the floor and standing in the hall outside of the meeting room. With a live demonstration of the technology and representatives from Ex Libris and the NISO committee on the panel, the 75-seat room was inadequate for the 200 or so librarians trying to attend. Internet connections in convention center meeting rooms were extraordinarily rare in 2001, in part because they were prohibitively expensive. It was $1000 well spent!

               I spent a great deal of time exploring the world of free academic electronic journals in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The CLS Online Journal Database (OJDB), implemented by Ed Sponsler, CLS software developer, and curated by me, provided a ready home to document the titles and extent of access. The OJDB permitted the Library to track click-throughs, giving us insight into:

                Congratulations on your new position as our Librarian for Engineering and Applied Science! What appealed to you about this position?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you—I’m so glad to be here. Since pursuing librarianship, it has been my goal to support research in an academic library setting, ideally in a scientific or technical discipline. So I really can’t think of anywhere I’d rather be than here, at an institution dedicated to research excellence that’s constantly at the frontier of scientific knowledge. What I also found appealing was Caltech’s small size—especially compared to other universities with similar research outputs. I imagine this will enhance the human aspect of the job, making it more feasible to maintain working relationships with students, faculty, and staff in the division, and to stay tuned into what individuals are working on.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                During your interview, we were all interested in your internship with the Executive Office of the President. Could you tell us a little about it?

              </p>
              <p>
               I was very lucky to intern last summer in the Library of the Executive Office of the President in Washington, DC. The library’s mission is to support EOP staff, which includes the staff of the White House Office, in their work for the president of the United States. While the library of course holds all sorts of legal materials and government documents, it also maintains a print collection of popular nonfiction books—covering policy areas and political and presidential history—much like what you would find in a public library. During my internship, I helped to field reference questions from EOP staff, which varied widely in scope. Responding to a request could be as simple as retrieving a newspaper article or recommending some books on a certain issue, or it could be as involved as examining the legislative history of a particular regulation.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                You recently completed your degree in library science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. What are some things that you've learned that you can bring to this new role?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               One course I found to be particularly valuable and enjoyable focused on collection management. Through a series of projects for the course, I got experience evaluating a large collection for content strengths and gaps—and identifying candidate materials for acquisition as well as for removal from the collection. I hope to apply similar skills to ensure that the Caltech Library’s collection stays appropriately tailored to the research being conducted in the EAS division. I was also lucky in that there are many libraries on the UW-Madison campus, so over the course of my time there, I was able to work in a few that specialized in different scientific disciplines.

               <strong>
                What do you like about working in libraries? What inspired you to pursue a career as a librarian?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               One short answer is that I like finding stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
               As an undergrad, my favorite part of any research assignment was always getting all my resources together—following trails of bibliographies and navigating physical and digital library spaces to locate anything that might be relevant. It was then that I first floated the possibility of pursuing a career in librarianship and started talking to librarians at my university about their work.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am also very interested in the research process. Although I don’t think I would have it in me to do research myself, I very much like the idea of working in a research-adjacent role, where I can have a broad view of the information lifecycle and of knowledge production in a wider range of disciplines.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lastly, I’d be disingenuous not to mention the lifestyle considerations in my decision to pursue librarianship: A library is a pleasant space in which to pass a workday, and one that I find relatively easy to get out of bed for. There are books around. There’s not a lot of yelling. Hardly ever an emergency. If any career path is mentally sustainable for me, it’s this one.
              </p>

               <strong>
                What are some of your goals, hopes, and/or plans for working with the Division of Engineering and Applied Science?

              </p>
              <p>
               My plan is to keep in close contact with the various EAS departments, so that I can stay up to date on the research and education happening throughout the division, and make sure that the library’s collections and services accommodate the division’s needs. I’m also hoping to help uphold this institution’s tradition of benefiting society, by making sure that the knowledge produced in the EAS division is disseminated as widely, and has as great an impact, as possible.

              </p>
              <p>
               Please join us in welcoming Alvaro Quezada as the Library's new Head of Access and Collection Services! Alvaro is joining us from USC’s Science &amp; Engineering Library where he was a subject librarian. Prior to that position, he was a library supervisor for access services at USC’s Norris Medical Library. He holds a master’s in management in library and information science from USC and a bachelor’s of science in criminal justice from CSULA.
              </p>
              <p>
               With his experience as both a staff member and a supervisor in access services and as a subject librarian for science and engineering, Alvaro has a unique blend of skills and experiences that will benefit ACS and Caltech Library as a whole. Alvaro started on Monday, May 20, and we're grateful that he found some time this week to answer some questions about his new role.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Congratulations on your new position as Head of Access &amp; Collection Services, Alvaro! Could you give us an introduction to what the Access &amp; Collection Services department traditionally handles in a library?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you! The Access &amp; Collection Services department in a library plays a critical role in managing and facilitating user access to library resources. Traditionally, this department encompasses several key functions. For starters, and the most visible to the library community, is Circulation. Circulation manages the lending of library materials and resources to library users and provides frontline support to users, answering questions related to library services, resources, and policies.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another key function is Interlibrary Loan and Document Delivery (ILL). This service allows users to request access to resources that are not owned by their institution. The ILL department will scour the country, if not the world, to provide the user access to the physical or electronic version of the resources they need.
              </p>
              <p>
               Furthermore, Reserve Services and Collection Maintenance are also key functions of the department. Reserve Services manages the course reserves and other high-usage materials. Collection Maintenance ensures that the library’s physical collection is well-organized and accessible to all users.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Can you tell us a little about your previous work at USC?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Absolutely! At USC Libraries, I was a Science and Engineering Librarian as the subject liaison for mathematics, biology, earth sciences, physics, and astronomy. I provided research assistance to students, faculty, and researchers and designed and delivered instructional sessions on information literacy, research strategies, and effective use of library resources.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What are some lessons that you've learned in that position that you can bring to this new role?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               There are several lessons that I have learned as a Science and Engineering Librarian that are going to be extremely beneficial in my new role. Most notably, learning to adapt to new challenges and environments is crucial. Having made the transition from staff to faculty in this role amidst the pandemic meant I had to not only undertake the new responsibilities of the position but determine how to complete these deliverables remotely. This experience is going to be critical in learning how to undertake the responsibilities of a library administrator (a first for me) and familiarizing myself with the various systems and workflows. Another lesson that I will bring to my new role is project management. I quickly learned the nature of the librarian position is heavily projects based. Balancing multiple projects and meeting deadlines provided me with the experience to effectively prioritize tasks, manage time efficiently, and clearly define expectations, all of which are going to be essential in my new role.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What do you like about working in libraries? What inspired you to pursue a career as a library administrator?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               There is an extensive list of the things I find gratifying about working in an academic library. At the top of the list is the intellectual vibrancy and engagement that permeates the campus. These vibes are incredibly contagious and powerful enough to infuse creativity and motivation. Working in an environment that offers this experience every time I arrive on campus is an incredible way to spend my day.
              </p>
              <p>
               The second-best thing I enjoy about working in an academic library is the contribution we make to the academic and professional achievements to our community of students, faculty, staff, and researchers. Whether it is the access to the collection of our resources, our study spaces, research support, or instruction services, in one subtle way (or in some instances, not so subtle ways), we were indispensable to their overall success.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pursuing a career as a library administrator stems from several key motivations. The first being the opportunity to obtain a position of leadership. I have always been passionate about leading teams, setting strategic directions, and managing projects and this position presented that opportunity. In addition, throughout my career, I have been fortunate to work with mentors who demonstrated the importance of effective library leadership. Due to this experience, I have had the opportunity to establish the essential skills necessary to pursue a path where I can foster an environment of empowerment and collaboration and demonstrate to colleagues the same fundamentals.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What are some of your goals, hopes, or plans for the future of the Access &amp; Collection Services department?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The goal for the future of the Access &amp; Collection Services department is to continue reimagining our services, staying at the forefront of best practices, and evaluating emerging technologies to enhance the library experience for the Caltech community. In essence, to commit ourselves to the pursuit of academic excellence that is synonymous with the reputation of Caltech.
              </p>
              <p>
               In terms of the wonderful folks in the Access &amp; Collection Services department, my plans are to support their professional growth, and contribute to creating a positive and motivating atmosphere that promotes collaboration and appreciation of each contributing team member.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                We're looking forward to working with you, Alvaro!

              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The Caltech Library is happy to announce that, as of April 8, Paula Gaetos is our new Programming and Student Engagement Librarian!
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               Paula joined Caltech Library in 2018 as Information Services Generalist Assistant, previously working as a library clerk at school and public libraries. During her time at the Library, Paula has made significant contributions to the TechHub, the Library's Events &amp; Programming Committee, and Library signage. In December 2022, she completed her master’s degree in library and information science from San Jose State University. We are pleased that she agreed to answer some questions about her new role.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                1) Congratulations on your new position, Paula! Could you give us an introduction to what a Programming &amp; Student Engagement Librarian does?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks! I’m really grateful and honored to take on this new role at the Library. A Programming &amp; Student Engagement Librarian is responsible for developing and implementing library programming and events that support our students’ engagement and success at Caltech, particularly for our undergraduate and historically underrepresented students.
              </p>
              <p>
               It can be events like our Outdoor Movie Nights or Craft-a-Mole for Mole Day that provide a space to hang out and decompress with other students. It can also be developing outreach initiatives, like tabling at campus events or hosting workshops, to help demystify accessing and utilizing library resources so our students are well equipped to reach their learning and research goals.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                2) What are some of the developments in the Library that created the need for this new position?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The biggest development in the Library was formalizing our mission statement and strategic plan. By expressing our values and commitment to inclusive practices and prioritizing campus partnership and collaborations, it generated the momentum to develop initiatives that reflected those statements.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               So in 2021, when our students and campus community returned to campus in full capacity, we picked up on the need for everyone to acclimate and reconnect with campus resources and with each other. This led to the formation of the Events and Programming Committee. Since then, we've been developing and assessing what library events and programming were implemented before and how to redevelop them to suit our students’ current needs in order to foster belonging and familiarity, like the TechHub open house or creating cultural heritage celebratory displays. We happily saw an overall increase in library resource usage and a number of first-time participants in library events as a result, especially from undergraduates.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               With such a positive response and growing interest in its development, it was clear this kind of outreach was an integral part of our Library services and required a dedicated role.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                3) What will a day in the life of the Programming &amp; Student Engagement Librarian look like?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               We’re just getting started, so I can’t really say for sure what would be typical, but I anticipate my workload involves a lot of planning ahead. So my day may simply start with staring at a four-month white board calendar and the annual events calendar to see what needs to be prepared for upcoming events.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               It could mean connecting with the undergraduate office about their anticipated plans for next year’s new student welcome week or prepping “outreach boxes,” which are simply the mailboxes we fill with outreach materials, like flyers, stickers, and free pencils to bring to tabling events, like the DiscoTech resource fair happening this month.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                4) You've previously been the co-chair of the Events and Programming Committee. What are some lessons that you've learned in that leadership position that you can bring to this new role?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The most important lesson was to allow space to say no and adapt to that boundary. EPCOM is a small and mighty team who found themselves at one point creating and participating in at least five events per term. When we laid out an annual events calendar that anticipated regular events like Ditch Day or holidays, like Lunar New Year, it’s possible to have up to ten events per term. April itself has #Gaypril, National Library Week, and Earth Week in addition to 3MT, DiscoTech, and Grad Student Appreciation Week.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               It'll be easy to be ambitious and participate in all of them simply because this work is truly interesting and a well-done event is fun and satisfying to put together. It’s also a way to burn out a team’s energy and engagement in the long run.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               By allowing the space to assess, prioritize, and delegate which events we participate in—being able to say no—we’re able to keep the creative energy to develop something new or improve on what we’ve done before.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                5) What will you be able to do with programming and student engagement now that you can give them your full attention?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The Library absolutely has a role to play in creating a safe and engaging campus to support our students academically and holistically. So my hope is that we’re able to formalize our signature programming and events that center the Library as a third space for our campus community.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               In addition, my biggest challenge is to be able to measure the Library’s impact and value to our students during their years here at Caltech. So as part of formalizing signature programming and events, I want to focus on creating programming assessments so we can document and communicate that impact in a really meaningful way.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                6) What are some things we can look forward to in the future of Caltech Library events and programming?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               In the short-term, newer and different free snack options during Stress Free Library events. I would love to get more of our students’ opinions on what they like to snack on while studying.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               In the long-term, I really look forward to working with everyone in the Library to brainstorm utilizing all our Library spaces to host events, like the maker projects at the TechHub. I also really hope to connect more with other departments on campus for future events, especially for New Student Welcome Week.
              </p>
