               <strong>
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The Caltech Library is happy to announce that, as of April 8, Paula Gaetos is our new Programming and Student Engagement Librarian!
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               Paula joined Caltech Library in 2018 as Information Services Generalist Assistant, previously working as a library clerk at school and public libraries. During her time at the Library, Paula has made significant contributions to the TechHub, the Library's Events &amp; Programming Committee, and Library signage. In December 2022, she completed her master’s degree in library and information science from San Jose State University. We are pleased that she agreed to answer some questions about her new role.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                1) Congratulations on your new position, Paula! Could you give us an introduction to what a Programming &amp; Student Engagement Librarian does?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks! I’m really grateful and honored to take on this new role at the Library. A Programming &amp; Student Engagement Librarian is responsible for developing and implementing library programming and events that support our students’ engagement and success at Caltech, particularly for our undergraduate and historically underrepresented students.
              </p>
              <p>
               It can be events like our Outdoor Movie Nights or Craft-a-Mole for Mole Day that provide a space to hang out and decompress with other students. It can also be developing outreach initiatives, like tabling at campus events or hosting workshops, to help demystify accessing and utilizing library resources so our students are well equipped to reach their learning and research goals.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                2) What are some of the developments in the Library that created the need for this new position?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The biggest development in the Library was formalizing our mission statement and strategic plan. By expressing our values and commitment to inclusive practices and prioritizing campus partnership and collaborations, it generated the momentum to develop initiatives that reflected those statements.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               So in 2021, when our students and campus community returned to campus in full capacity, we picked up on the need for everyone to acclimate and reconnect with campus resources and with each other. This led to the formation of the Events and Programming Committee. Since then, we've been developing and assessing what library events and programming were implemented before and how to redevelop them to suit our students’ current needs in order to foster belonging and familiarity, like the TechHub open house or creating cultural heritage celebratory displays. We happily saw an overall increase in library resource usage and a number of first-time participants in library events as a result, especially from undergraduates.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               With such a positive response and growing interest in its development, it was clear this kind of outreach was an integral part of our Library services and required a dedicated role.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                3) What will a day in the life of the Programming &amp; Student Engagement Librarian look like?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               We’re just getting started, so I can’t really say for sure what would be typical, but I anticipate my workload involves a lot of planning ahead. So my day may simply start with staring at a four-month white board calendar and the annual events calendar to see what needs to be prepared for upcoming events.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               It could mean connecting with the undergraduate office about their anticipated plans for next year’s new student welcome week or prepping “outreach boxes,” which are simply the mailboxes we fill with outreach materials, like flyers, stickers, and free pencils to bring to tabling events, like the DiscoTech resource fair happening this month.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                4) You've previously been the co-chair of the Events and Programming Committee. What are some lessons that you've learned in that leadership position that you can bring to this new role?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The most important lesson was to allow space to say no and adapt to that boundary. EPCOM is a small and mighty team who found themselves at one point creating and participating in at least five events per term. When we laid out an annual events calendar that anticipated regular events like Ditch Day or holidays, like Lunar New Year, it’s possible to have up to ten events per term. April itself has #Gaypril, National Library Week, and Earth Week in addition to 3MT, DiscoTech, and Grad Student Appreciation Week.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               It'll be easy to be ambitious and participate in all of them simply because this work is truly interesting and a well-done event is fun and satisfying to put together. It’s also a way to burn out a team’s energy and engagement in the long run.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               By allowing the space to assess, prioritize, and delegate which events we participate in—being able to say no—we’re able to keep the creative energy to develop something new or improve on what we’ve done before.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                5) What will you be able to do with programming and student engagement now that you can give them your full attention?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               The Library absolutely has a role to play in creating a safe and engaging campus to support our students academically and holistically. So my hope is that we’re able to formalize our signature programming and events that center the Library as a third space for our campus community.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               In addition, my biggest challenge is to be able to measure the Library’s impact and value to our students during their years here at Caltech. So as part of formalizing signature programming and events, I want to focus on creating programming assessments so we can document and communicate that impact in a really meaningful way.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               <strong>
                6) What are some things we can look forward to in the future of Caltech Library events and programming?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               In the short-term, newer and different free snack options during Stress Free Library events. I would love to get more of our students’ opinions on what they like to snack on while studying.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               In the long-term, I really look forward to working with everyone in the Library to brainstorm utilizing all our Library spaces to host events, like the maker projects at the TechHub. I also really hope to connect more with other departments on campus for future events, especially for New Student Welcome Week.

                In our previous interview when you arrived at Caltech in June 2020, I asked you what you liked about working in libraries. What did you specifically enjoy about working for the Caltech Library?

               The people I worked with and Access and Collections Services' dedication to IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility) was key in my daily motivation. My ACS colleagues (Phuong, Laurel, Bianca, Mel, Dan, Ben P., Ben M., Viet, Paula, Becky, Ling, Rebecca, Andy, and Kris) exemplified true teamwork, overcoming personal and professional differences. Their intentions, always rooted in understanding their triggers and their desire to provide the best services possible, significantly influenced our work, the team, and our patrons. They were an absolute dream to work with. The next department head will be VERY fortunate. The Library leadership team (Donna, Catherine, Stephen, and Peter) provided me with such a rich learning environment and a safe space for collaboration. Together, we tackled challenging goals, supported each other daily, and made a meaningful impact. I'll deeply miss our discussions.
              </p>
              <p>
               Kara's mentorship was transformative, giving my ideas a platform and guiding me towards a lifelong commitment to librarianship. Her influence reshaped my career path, I will especially miss her guidance.

                When you started at the Library, we were all remote! Looking back, how did that auspicious beginning influence your transition to Caltech? What did you learn about working at Caltech that influenced your time at the Library once we all returned to in-person services?

              </p>
              <p>
               Remote work taught me the importance of face-to-face interactions in building successful relationships. Despite the challenges, consistent and effective use of virtual platforms like Zoom facilitated progress and helped maintain connections during the lockdown. Meeting colleagues in person after virtual interactions bridged the gap swiftly, which really supported our collaboration.

               The mission of Caltech Archives and Special Collections is to facilitate understanding of Caltech's role in the history of science and technology and of the research and lives of its community. Earlier this fall, the Archives conducted a search for an Archival Processing Intern to assist with surveying, arranging, and describing physical and digital records held at the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories (GALCIT), Division of Engineering and Applied Science.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) was a research institute created in 1926, at first specializing in aeronautics research. In 1930, Hungarian scientist Theodore von Karman accepted the directorship of the lab and emigrated to the United States. Under his leadership, work on rockets began there in 1936. In 1961 the name changed to Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories at the California Institute of Technology. In 2006 GALCIT was once again renamed, taking on the new and current name of Graduate Aerospace Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology (while continuing to maintain the acronym GALCIT) in order to reflect its vigorous re-engagement with space engineering and with JPL.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the conclusion of the search, DiAndra Reyes was chosen to be our new GALCIT Archival Processing Intern. She is a second year Master of Library and Information Science student at San José State University. DiAndra agreed to answer some questions so we could get to know her better.

               <strong>
                Hi DiAndra! We're happy to welcome you as the Library's new Archival Processing Intern. This position was funded by the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories (GALCIT) and you were chosen from many qualified candidates. What drew you to apply to this position?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Hello! I am truly honored to have been selected as the new GALCIT Processing Intern. Firstly, I want to thank GALCIT, Caltech Library, and Archives for giving me such an amazing professional development opportunity. There were many factors that drew me to this position. One of my motivating factors for applying was that I felt really aligned with the Caltech Archives’ focus on facilitating an understanding of Caltech’s pivotal role in the history of science and technology. I really got a sense from the job posting, as well as talking to Mariella Soprano and Kara Whatley in the interview, that the Archives and Institute really care about the preservation and discovery of its history and people, while at the same time they have a forward-looking approach to doing archival work.
              </p>
              <p>
               Although I do not have a background in Aerospace Engineering, the chance to immerse myself in a subject area with which I am less familiar adds an enriching dimension to the experience and gives me a unique opportunity to become a more versatile and collaborative archivist who can adapt to any field. Furthermore, I’ve been in the San José State University Master of Library and Information Science online program for two and a half years, and the opportunity to work on-site, get hands-on experience with the physical materials, and build interpersonal relationships with the staff and faculty, really enticed me.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What kind of courses are you currently taking in the MLIS program at San José State?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I’m currently taking an Archives Reference class, where I’m learning about reference processes, guidelines, legalities, etc. in archival institutions. Additionally, I am also doing a fall semester internship at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles, which I will be receiving school credit for.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Now that you've started working in the Archives, what does a typical day in the life of a GALCIT Archival Processing Intern look like?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               A typical day for me involves arriving at my office in the Guggenheim building at 9 a.m. Mariella Soprano, my supervisor, meets me there around the same time. I first check my calendar and emails to confirm what meetings I have for the day. Then I start working with Mariella in going through materials. We work together to decide what to keep and what to throw away, as well as conducting some basic preservation procedures like removing rusty staples and clips and flattening out papers. Then we figure out how to categorize and organize the materials into series and subseries. I input the data for the materials into a spreadsheet with titles, dates, creators, scope and content notes, etc. This spreadsheet will later be imported into ArchivesSpace. Next, I put the materials in archival folders and in their respective sections on shelves in my office. Sometimes, I also spend part of my day researching GALCIT and its history. The GALCIT website and the Caltech Archives’ oral histories website have served as valuable resources in understanding the context of the materials we are discovering.

                What can you tell us about the Archives you're working on?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The GALCIT archives is a treasure trove of materials dating from the 1930s and 1940s through the present, consisting of records from the department’s initiatives and projects. It’s really a Pandora’s box, and we have still yet to know what we will find. So far, we know there are papers, large plans and drawings, and audio/visual materials. The commitment of the GALCIT department in taking the initiative to preserve all this history is truly commendable. The collection will be stored in GALCIT, in the basement of the Firestone building, while under the guardianship of the Archives department.

               <strong>
                What do you enjoy so far about working at Caltech?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Working at Caltech has been an enriching experience so far, particularly due to the opportunity to interact with diverse individuals at GALCIT, the Archives, and the Library. Learning from passionate professionals who are doing amazing work has been truly inspiring. I hope to continue learning as much as I can about how each department functions and their impacts on the Caltech community as a whole.

               <strong>
                Is there anything you'd like us to know before we go?

              </p>
              <p>
               I would like to express my gratitude for the warm welcome from everyone and the opportunity to be a part of the Caltech community. I look forward to sharing our discoveries of the GALCIT collection in the near future!

               Over the summer, thanks to the American Institute of Physics (AIP) Grant for Archives, the Archives hired SJSU MLIS student, Gabriela Lazo, to begin processing the Robert F. Christy Papers. They continued with us through the fall term. In addition to the Christy papers, they were able to experience Archives and Library operations by attending staff meetings, scanning documents, and learning about archival reference. Before moving on to finish their degree, we asked Gabriela some questions about their time at Caltech. We thank Gabriela for helping the Caltech Archives and wish them well on their journey.
              </p>
              <p>
               Gabriela Lazo (they/them) worked as Archives Processing Intern for the 2023 summer term and into the fall, and they live in East Los Angeles, where they were raised. Gabriela has a BA in Sociology and Chicanx Studies with specializations in Social Movements/Political Sociology and Equity/Diversity from Cal State Northridge, and they will receive their Master of Library and Information Science from San Jose State by December 2023. Gabriela spends much of their free time visiting local museums and libraries, along with getting involved in their community through mutual aid work and a radical book club!

               <strong>
                1) Hi Gabriela! How have you enjoyed your position as our first Archival Processing Intern?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I've enjoyed my time at Caltech immensely! I've learned not just about the archives field, but also of the history of Caltech and the discoveries made here. My supervisor, Penny, creates an amazing environment for me to learn about what goes into being an archivist. Not only that, but I also enjoyed the events that take place on campus, such as resource fairs and new building ceremonies. It feels as if I've only explored the tip of the iceberg of what Caltech has to offer.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                2) Robert F. Christy, who lived from 1916 to 2012, made instrumental contributions to the development of nuclear weapons in the Manhattan Project. After World War II, he went on to study the biological and health effects of radiation and conducted research in astrophysics on cosmic rays and Cepheid variable stars. Christy also served as provost and acting president of Caltech. The Christy Papers consist of correspondence, lab notebooks, photographs and slides, and other documents related to his work on dosimetry, astrophysics, and Caltech administration. Could you tell us a little about your work processing the Christy Papers?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The Christy Papers aided me in understanding the processing of archives. I began by sorting through his correspondence, which includes letters to and from world-renowned scientists. I sorted the correspondence by chronological order and created series and sub-series under the guidance of Penny. I’ve learned a great deal about Christy’s work as Caltech Provost and his involvement in the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. Christy began his work studying theoretical physics and later went on to study astrophysics. Later in life, he studied dosimetry and the effects of atomic bombings on populations impacted by bombings. I added this information to ArchivesSpace (the archives management database), making it discoverable for researchers.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                3) What does a day in the life of an Archival Processing Intern look like?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               A day in the life of an Archival Processing Intern looks like getting started by checking any emails or any online updates each morning. Then I'd begin processing the Christy papers where I last left off. Much of the materials consist of correspondence between Robert Christy and other Caltech admin dating back to the 1950s. I sort based on the contents of the materials. Additionally, I’ve also delved into work dealing with Amos G. Throop collection and the founding of Caltech. I also had the opportunity to shadow other librarians to understand the important work they do for students and researchers. Besides my archival work, I sometimes have time set out to explore the campus or join in on any events occurring at the time. I got to see something new every day at Caltech!
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                4) You're enrolled in the Master of Library and Information Science program at San Jose State University. How has it been studying in a fully online program? How has the coursework helped in processing the Christy papers?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               San Jose State's MLIS online program has provided me with a better understanding of the responsibilities of an archivist. I’ve taken courses on information communities, digital tools, cataloging, coding, and applied research. I’ve taken skills from both school and this position and utilized them in my assignments in both settings. An online schooling experience has also provided me with flexibility in my schedule for opportunities such as my position at Caltech. I feel that I've achieved a great work-school-life balance due to the program's convenience. I still have time to visit museums and libraries, along with getting involved in my community in my free time.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                5) What do you think is the most important function of any archival project?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I believe that the most important function of any archival project is to provide the people with access to history. The archivist's role is to make materials and other resources easily accessible to patrons. This aligns with my principles of making education accessible for all. There is an information gap that primarily impacts marginalized communities, so archival projects must take into account accessibility and reach. Access to quality information is a human right.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                6) What do you hope to do when you complete your degree?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I hope to work in the GLAM field (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) when I complete my degree by the end of this year. I have a passion for art and history, which I would like to pursue in my profession as an archivist. My time at Caltech, along with work in other libraries and museums, has taught me that I seek to devote my time to being an information professional.
