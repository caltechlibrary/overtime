     Caltech Library is pleased to announce that CaltechDATA, our institutional data and software repository, launched a major upgrade on Wednesday September 21, 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
     CaltechDATA has served as critical research infrastructure for campus since 2017, and it hosts over 20,000 records containing datasets and software for a wide variety of disciplines. With this launch, CaltechDATA now runs on the open-source InvenioRDM platform and brings many new features that Caltech researchers have requested:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
       Easier record creation with autocomplete for creators, affiliations, subjects, and funders
      </p>
     </li>
     <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
       Automatic record versioning
      </p>
     </li>
     <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
       Private share link for reviewers
      </p>
     </li>
     <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
       Improved record views, with dynamic citations and an expanded file previewer
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr">
     This version of CaltechDATA also introduces communities, which enable groups at Caltech to create their own record curation and approval processes. Researchers can collect records into a single browse and search interface. A curation pipeline allows records to be submitted by Caltech users, and then approved by a defined set of curators. Weâ€™ve pre-seeded a small number of initial communities, and look forward to seeing what researchers create.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
     InvenioRDM is a customizable open-source repository platform developed by CERN and twenty partner organizations, including Caltech Library. It is built on the twenty-year history of the Invenio repository platform, whose most-successful implementation is the Zenodo generalist repository hosted by CERN. InvenioRDM takes the features of Zenodo and makes them customizable for institutions. InvenioRDM will enable Caltech Library to more rapidly roll out new features and collaborate with other institutions to establish repository best practices.
