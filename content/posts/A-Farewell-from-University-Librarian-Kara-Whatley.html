    <h4>
     This message will be my final greeting as Caltech’s university librarian, and I would like to take a moment to reflect on what the Library has accomplished in the last five years. The Caltech Library staff, including the Caltech Archives &amp; Special Collections, are an amazing team dedicated to supporting the mission of the Institute, and I have been privileged to work with all of them. I am proud of what we have accomplished together, and I know they are, too.

     EVENTS
    </h4>
    <p>
     One of the greatest areas of growth since 2019 is in our programming and outreach efforts, especially in our student focused events. In collaboration with the Graduate Studies Office, we’ve produced 3MT and Dissertation Writer’s Bootcamp events for our graduate students each of the past three years.

       —an academic research communication competition developed by The University of Queensland in Australia—awarded over $25,000 in prizes with support from the American Physical Society, EBSCO, Elsevier, IOP Publishing, Science of Synthesis/Thieme Chemistry, Springer/Nature, Wiley, and more. The Three Minute Thesis competition challenges Caltech graduate students to explain their research in an engaging and clear three-minute talk intended for a non-specialist audience.

        Dissertation Writers Bootcamp:
       </strong>
       The Caltech Library and the Graduate Studies Office Dissertation Writers Bootcamp provides a calm, distraction-free environment for writing, along with refreshments and writing and formatting support. Over the two days, optional consultations with the Hixon Writing Center and Caltech librarians will help students address formatting, copyright, data, and writing questions.  We hold two bootcamps per academic year, and each one hosts 12-18 dissertation writers.

        S.F.L. = Stress Free Library:
       </strong>
       Each term we turn Sherman Fairchild Library, aka SFL, into the Stress Free Library during midterms and finals. SFL provides twenty-four hour study space and services to all Caltech students along with evening snacks and hot water, puzzle breaks, visits from the Huntington Hospital Pet Assisted Therapy volunteers (“the puppies”), our soundscape study and retreat room, and much more. We also sneak a little stress reduction in over the late spring, all summer, and early fall with our SFL Amphitheater outdoor movie nights.

        PST ART:
       </strong>
       The Caltech Archives was awarded a grant to prepare for the next edition of the region-wide arts initiative Pacific Standard Time: Art x Science x L.A., scheduled to open in 2024. Caltech is one of 45 cultural, educational, and scientific institutions throughout Southern California to receive support from the Getty Foundation for their projects, all of which will explore the intersection of art and science.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Caltech Archives’ project, “Crossing Over: Art &amp; Science at Caltech, 1920-2020,” will tell stories from Caltech’s 133 years of using art and images in science and engineering research, science communication, and building campus community.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pacific Standard Time: Art x Science x L.A. will include dozens of simultaneous exhibitions and programs focused on the intertwined histories of art and science, past and present, that together address some of the most complex challenges of the 21st century—from climate change and environmental racism to the current pandemic and artificial intelligence—and the creative solutions these problems demand.

     PROJECTS
    </h4>
    <p dir="ltr">
     The running joke around the Caltech Library is that I’ve never met a project I didn’t like, and there is some truth to that. Over the past five years, we’ve migrated all of our back-end library systems and implemented a few new systems solutions, such as ARES, our online course reserves tool that is linked to Caltech’s Canvas courses. Below are a few of the behind-the-scenes projects we’ve done to help bring a better library experience to the Caltech community.

        EZ Proxy &gt; Open Athens:
       </strong>
       After upgrading our proxy server, which allowed off-campus access to Library materials without using the VPN for improved security and performance for users, we switched off-campus authentication methods from EZproxy to OpenAthens.

        EBSCO/FOLIO/LibSearch:
       </strong>
       After much research and deliberation, the Caltech Library adopted the FOLIO Library Services Platform (LSP) for use starting in the fall 2021 term. FOLIO, which stands for the Future of Libraries Is Open, is “an open-source project supported by many academic libraries worldwide, and a number of commercial vendors, including EBSCO. EBSCO contributes substantially to the technical development of FOLIO software and offers FOLIO hosting and data management services.” FOLIO offers our patrons a more integrated library search experience.

        RFID Inventory:
       </strong>
       As part of our new system of RFID (radio frequency identification) tagging, we conducted a collection inventory. In addition to confirming what’s on our shelves, the completion of this project means that we can reconcile our holdings with OCLC, helping DocuServe be a better interlibrary loan lending partner and allowing us to update our SCELC Shared Print commitments. Correct SCELC Shared Print commitments will allow other SCELC libraries to weed their collections with confidence in knowing we are retaining copies of these items.

       CaltechDATA, our institutional data and software repository, launched a major upgrade on Wednesday, September 21, 2022. InvenioRDM enables Caltech Library to more rapidly roll out new features and collaborate with other institutions to establish repository best practices. Our

Most items in CaltechAUTHORS are articles, but there are also books, book chapters, conference papers, and more. The repository is updated continuously as departments and library staff add available and recently published documents.

(The Caltech Library’s very first NSF grant!)  Through a collaboration between the Library and Caltech’s Information Management Systems and Services (IMSS), the award will allow the standard free storage allocation in CaltechDATA to be expanded from 500 GB per research group to 1 TB per researcher.

     COLLECTIONS
    </h4>
    <p>
     Collections have been a major focus of the Library’s work in the past five years, and we hope you’ve noticed! We’ve negotiated with our publisher/vendor partners to bring our campus the research resources you all need, making access more seamless and putting up fewer barriers to research. Here are a few of our collection highlights:
