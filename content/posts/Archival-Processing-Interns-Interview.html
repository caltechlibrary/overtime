     Jo Krajeski and Benjamin Mendez Jr. worked as Archival Processing Interns this past spring and summer in the Caltech Archives and Special Collections processing the David L. Goodstein and the Judith R. Goodstein papers. This is the first time the Archives brought in two interns to collaboratively work in the archives. The Goodsteins both spent many hours in the Archives working and researching Caltech’s history, so it was fitting to have both collections successively processed. Both David’s and Judith’s collections are now both fully organized and accessible in the reading room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Collections and Metadata Archivist Penny Neder-Muro asked Jo and Benjamin some questions about their experiences as MLIS students and their time working as interns in the Caltech Archives. We want to thank Jo and Benjamin for helping the Archives preserve and make accessible the collections of two significant figures in Caltech’s history.
    </p>

      Thank you, Jo and Benjamin, for speaking with us today. You are both enrolled in San Jose State University’s Master of Library and Information Science fully online program. What drew you to pursue the MLIS degree?  And how has that program prepared you for this internship?

     My experience as an intern for the CSULB Center for the History of Video Games, Technology, and Critical Play drew me to enroll in the SJSU MLIS program. I enjoy information in general and its importance to people. During my time in SJSU’s program, I have learned tons about the LIS field, including archives. One course that helped a lot was a course called Archives and Manuscripts. This course reviewed the importance of archives as information spaces and how to be a successful archivist.

     Genealogy and a growing love for researching historical events inspired me to pursue an MLIS at SJSU. I have been studying archival and library science for a while now (my bachelor’s degree is also LIS focused), so I am well-educated but had little practical experience. I jumped at the chance to work in the Caltech Archives. I also hoped to gain smarts through osmosis.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Can you please briefly describe your work as a Caltech Archives Processing Intern?
     </strong>
    </p>

     <strong>
      JK:

     I had the privilege of appraising and organizing the collections of both David and Judith R Goodstein. Depending on the day my tasks included: applying basic preservation measures to rehouse the paper materials, moving them to acid-free folders/boxes, and organizing items alphabetically, chronologically or by subject. Once the collection order was determined, we created collection guides for researchers to quickly and easily locate the information sought within their collections. It was interesting to learn what was in a collection, which determined the best way to organize it and make it accessible to archives researchers.

     As an archives intern, I worked alongside you (Penny) and Jo on processing, which Jo mentioned. We rehoused David Goodstein’s papers into clean archival folders and boxes, organizing, then created

     for his entire collection. My day-to-day included arriving at the archive around 7:30 am till 12:30 pm, Monday only for the beginning of my internship, then after that; it sped up once summer began. Jo and I used a shared spreadsheet, and we communicated a lot about which organization made the most sense.

      David Goodstein was a member of the Caltech Faculty from 1968 through 2007, as Frank J. Gilloon Distinguished Teaching and Service Professor, who taught physics and served as Vice-Provost for almost twenty years. What is the one thing you learned while processing his collection that you would like the Caltech community and beyond to know about David Goodstein?

    </p>
    <p>

     One interesting fact I discovered when processing his collection was his love for his students and his upbeat, funny demeanor. From responding to fan letters for those who know him from the

     , to students' evaluation notes– It was amazing to see what a great teacher he was.

     He had a great sense of humor, which is strange to say about someone you have never met except on paper. He was also a very curious person, a great admirer (and friend) of Richard Feynman, and he formed strong lasting friendships with colleagues and others within his profession. I was very impressed by his ability and determination to learn Italian after he accepted an NSF fellowship in Rome. He would not only learn to communicate with his fellow lab team, but he would give seminars solely in Italian. I have great respect for David Goodstein.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jo, you also had the opportunity to process Judith Goodstein’s Papers. Judith is University Archivist emeritus and founded the Caltech Archives in 1968. What do you want to share about Judy?
     </strong>

     Judy, Judy, Judy. As a history buff, I enjoyed going through her collection, seeing her research process and eventual culmination of the research. She, like David, had a knack for forming lifelong relationships with colleagues and those she met through her research. I enjoyed creating

     too. I look forward to reading her books in the near future.

    <p>
     <strong>
      What is one surprising thing you learned while working in the Archives?
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      JK:
     </strong>
     I guess what surprises me the most about working in archives in general is the number of ways actions can be performed; there is no one way to do any task, but the outcome is the same: to provide access to the collections. I didn’t quite know what to expect from the Caltech Archives and Special collections, but I learned there is more interesting history to be found within their stacks than I ever realized.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      BM:
     </strong>
     Of the many important things I learned this summer, one that will stick with me is that every collection is different, and depending on the circumstances, decisions can change; as Penny would say, “It depends.” While archives have standards set in place, every day could be different, and sometimes exceptions are made. A lot depends on donor agreements and the information being processed, such as medical records or classified materials.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      What do you hope to do when you complete your MLIS degree?
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      JK:
     </strong>
     Ultimately, my goal is to remain in the archival field, but I am open to anywhere in the LIS field. I have really enjoyed my time working in an academic environment, but my passion lies with genealogy so maybe a state or local archive, or something along those lines. Working with NARA would be an accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      BM:
     </strong>
     After graduation, I plan to work in an academic library or in an archives. If I take the librarian route, I would love to work at a community college or CSU in either an education or systems librarian role. If I go with the archivist route, I would love to work in an archive revolving around technology and video games. With only a year left in my MLIS, I am anxious but excited for what will come. The road will be tough, but I am ready for the challenge!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Any final thoughts?
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      JK:
     </strong>
     This experience has been amazing. I have learned so much and felt so welcomed by the archives staff (and by extension the library crew) from my arrival to departure. I was given several learning opportunities, such as helping with reference, that helped with my coursework and gave me the hands-on experience I desired. I feel prepared to embark on other adventures and hope the archives’ staff continue to share their wisdom with future interns and students.
    </p>
    <p>

     I would like to thank all the archives and library staff who have assisted me through my internship at Caltech, especially Penny, Richard, Mariella, Elisa, and Peter. You have all been great to work with, and I hope our paths cross again someday.
